Thanks for checking out Roam Research. \nRoam is pretty similar to tree based online tools like Workflowy or Dynalist -- but it is specifically designed to help you connect thoughts together and group together related bits of information-- without copy/pasting or trying to remember where you put things all the time. \nHere are the key things about [[Roam]] that make it different from [[Workflowy]] \nWhen you have an idea or concept that you think you are going to be talking about on in many locations throughout your tree (or suspect you've already referenced a bunch), you can create a page by hitting the / command and using \"Link\" -- or you can just wrap the text in double brackets \nLinks are \"Bi-directional\" meaning that anytime you link to something, that thing collects all the locations it has been linked to -- so you can move back and forth between ideas fluidly -- you can \"Roam around!\"  -- see also [[Bidirectional Links]]\nLinks can also act as filters (on the page, or when looking through mentions)\nso, if I have a notes like ((2875))\nI can later on filter all my meeting notes to see who I spoke with about something like [[Time Management]] -- or when I look at the page for Will or Tiago I can easily refer back to notes from the last time we hung out, or see what topics we have spoken about\nDon't worry about naming things correctly -- if you change the name of a page it will change the title of all the links to that page -- if you realize two concepts are actually the same, you can change one of them to have the same title as the other and you'll have the option to \"merge\" the two pages together.\nSame applies to #[[tags]] -- if you type # you will get an autocomplete for all of your pages that are only one word \nTags and links function the same way -- they just look a little different, but they both create new pages and collect all references to the page\n[[Tangent]]: A note about inferred links\nThe [[Mentions]] component will search your database for any place where you used the words in the title of the page, to help you spot links you haven't formally created yet. \nTo see how this can be really useful for research watch this video\n((2018))\nThe really killer feature is referencing and embedding other \"Blocks\" or \"Bullets\"from elsewhere in your notes.  Again, you can use the / command to find this (or just write out two parenthesis and start typing to get the autocomplete up)\nA block in one part of the tree\nwith children\nA reference to ((1248))\nEmbedding that block and it's children\n{{embed: ((1248))}}\nChanging things in one place will change them in all their references\nWhen a block has been referenced or embedded in multiple places you'll see a counter on the left side of it, which shows you that it is referenced or embedded in other places -- clicking that button will open up the sidebar and show you the other locations of the block\nIf you're curious how or why you might use this check out ((2428))\n [[Experimental]]\nYou can alias those blocks too if you want the reference, but not to show the full text of the referenced item\n{{alias: ((1248)) X}} is superior to {{alias: ((1249)) Y}}\nThis is useful for referencing big paragraphs or creating footnotes-- but still having a link structure to help you wander (or Roam!) through your thoughts\nThe other big difference with Roam is we encourage you to keep all your random notes in the [[Daily Notes]] section -- here we create a new page for you each day automatically\nThe daily notes link in the left sidebar will bring you to the log of all the day pages -- so you can scroll through and get a sense of how your time has been spent\nYou can reference other days using the date feature (also available from the / command) -- like other things, it's markdown, but when you leave that textarea it'll give you a calendar component for picking a date and putting that in the right format to get stored in the daily log\nFor example try clicking this {{date}}\nYou may find the TODO feature useful, it is also visible from the / command -- this will give you a checkbox for marking things done -- but under the hood it just uses the same Tags / Links functionality as the rest of Roam -- it just changes the tag from TODO to DONE and back when you toggle the checkbox\n{{[[DONE]]}} Record a demo video of Roam #Conor\n{{[[DONE]]}} Finish writing [[Roam for Zettlekasting]]\n[[Roam Sidebar]]\nIf you Shift-Click on a tag or title you can open that page in the right-sidebar\nYou can also left-click on a bullet point to open that in the sidebar as well. \nThe sidebar can be helpful for looking at multiple things at once, rather than jumping between documents -- so you can more easily follow tangents an \"roam\" around in your ideas, without losing your place. \nFinal final note -- if you click on the title of a day in your daily notes, it'll just bring you to that page -- when you're focused on a page then you'll be able to see the [[Filter]] option at the top right of the page, which will filter the page to either hide things you don't want -- or only show paths which contain a tag/link you do want.\nFeel free to email me (cwhitesullivan at gmail dot com) or dm me on twitter (@conaw) anytime and I'll do my best to answer any of your questions\nmuch love\nConor\n[RoamBrain](https://www.roambrain.com/), [RoamTips](https://www.roamtips.com/about), & [RoamHacks](https://roamhacks.com/)\nCommunity-managed news and resources. \n[Slack Community](https://roamresearch.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-h695qjav-Rnlz8GFolVzFl8z3~U3tog#/) & [Discussion Forum](https://forum.roamresearch.com/)\nSearch for answers, troubleshoot with expert Roam users, and share best practices, workflows, & general feedback. \nFAQS\nWhat's the best way to use Roam?\nWell, there's no universal answer here.

Allenâs first book Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, published in 2001, became a National Bestseller. Allen has been called a personal productivity guru whose work has been featured in Fast Company, Fortune, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and other publications.\nThe book outlines his process\nThe entire process, including inputs, processing/thinking, and outputs (actions and action lists), is conveniently summarized in a flowchart provided in the book. \n((2054))\nAllenâs philosophy is that \nto be oneâs most productive self, one must be able to think clearly. \nIn order to think clearly, one must have completely downloaded from oneâs short-term memory or RAM (like computer RAM) all the \"open loops\" -- unfulfilled commitments one has made to oneself. \nClosing [[Open Loops]] frees the mind to do naturally what it does best -- think **about **things rather than **of **things. \nThree methods for decision making are listed in ((2274))\nOnce one has everything off his mind and written down, in paper or electronically, one has to decide, \"Whatâs the next action?\" \nThis is THE critical question. \nOnce this is decided, the action must be completed or tracked in a trusted system, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).\nAllen also has a [[Two Minute Rule]], which states that as one goes through their in-box and determines next actions, any next action that can be completed in two minutes or less should be completed immediately. In this way, a lot of items are touched only once and are forever cleared from \"psychic RAM.\"\nAllen outlines a process for getting RAM cleared in the first place and then for keeping it clear on a daily basis, as new things come into oneâs \"in\" box. The \"[[Whatâs the next action?]]\" question must be asked on the front-end, when the item from the \"in\" box is first reviewed.\nIt can help procrastinators, give you an edge, be useful at work or home\nMastering your time enables you to live in the present moment.\nPart 1 -- The Art of Getting Things Done\nChapter 1 -- A New Practice for a New Reality\nWith the societal shift to knowledge work, new behaviors and tools are required to successfully manage workflow. These behaviors and tools are incorporated into Allenâs methodology,\nObjectives of [[David Allen]]'s Methodology\nto capture all one needs to accomplish somewhere outside the brain\n Discipline oneself to make decisions about these items as they are added to oneâs workload.\nAllen states that \na person is the most productive when the mind is clear, free of [[Open Loops]]\nOpen Loops are the things people commit to do which remain undone and become a drag on the unconscious mind. \nHe uses the analogy of RAM on a personal computer, with the idea that too much \"stuff\" stored in a personâs short-term memory can blow a fuse. His idea is that the conscious mind is a focusing tool, not a storage place.\nIn addition, one must have [[Horizontal Focus]]\nwrite down the outcomes they wish to achieve. \nThen, for every outcome, one must determine the \"next physical action\" required to move the situation forward.\n This next physical action must be organized in a system one reviews regularly. \nChapter 2 -- Getting Control of Your Life: The Five Stages of Mastering Workflow\nAllen explains the five stages of mastering workflow: \ncollect\nprocess\norganize\nreview\ndo\n((2324))\nIn the Collection stage, the idea is to gather all the items that remain to be completed. Collection tools include the physical in-basket, paper-based and electronic note-taking devices, voice-recording devices and email. There are three \"collection success factors\": 1. Every open loop must be in your collection system and out of your head. 2. You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with. 3. You must empty them regularly.\n((2325))\nIn the Process stage, the bucket is emptied. Allen describes this as perhaps the most critical improvement for almost all the people heâs worked with. He outlines this process in great detail, complete with a flowchart. It asks:\nWhat is it? Is it actionable?\nIf not, trash it, put it in a tickler file or put it in a reference file.\nIf so, whatâs the next action? The next action is defined as the next physical, visible activity that needs to be engaged in, in order to move the current reality toward completion.\nWill next action take less than 2 minutes?\nIf yes, do it.\nIf no, delegate it or defer it.\nIf it will take longer than 2 minutes, consider it a project (defined as requiring more than one action step) and put it in your project plans which will be reviewed for actions.\n((2326))\nIn the Organize stage, Allen describes eight categories of reminders and materials: \ntrash\nincubation tools\nreference storage\nlist of projects\nstorage or files for project plans and materials\na calendar\na list of reminders of next actions\na list of reminders of things youâre waiting for.\n((2327))\nAllen says a Review of all oneâs lists, preferably weekly, is critical for success.\nChapter 3 -- Getting Projects Creatively Under Way: The Five Phases of Project Planning\nThis chapter is about [[Vertical Focus]] the thought process behind successful project planning.\nAllen states that the brain goes through five steps to accomplish most any [[task]] and that this Natural Planning Model is also the most effective for project planning. These steps are:\nDefining purpose and principles -- In defining purpose, one asks \"why?\" Answering this question provides the following benefits: it defines success, creates decision-making criteria, aligns resources, motivates, clarifies focus and expands options. Principles create the boundaries of the plan and define the criteria for excellence of behavior.\nOutcome visioning -- A vision provides a picture of the final result. Allen discusses the Reticular Activating System within the brain and how it acts like a search engine. In defining the desired outcome, this filter in the brain brings to oneâs attention those things that match the vision. In addition, Allen states that you wonât see how to do it until you see yourself doing it, and his advice is to view the project from beyond the completion date, envision \"WILD SUCCESS\", and capture features, aspects, qualities you imagine in place.\nBrainstorming -- Brainstorming identifies how one gets from here to there through the generation of lots of ideas. Allen recommends writing down these ideas to help generate many new ones that might not have occurred had the brain not been emptied by writing down the original ideas. Writing ideas down also provides an anchor to keep one focused on the topic at hand. This idea of writing to spur thinking has been labeled as \"distributed cognition\". Keys to effective brainstorming are: donât judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize; go for quantity, not quality; and put analysis and organization in the background.\nOrganizing -- Allen describes the key steps to include: identify the significant pieces; sort by components, sequences and/or priorities; and detail to the required degree.\nIdentifying next actions -- Allen states that a project is sufficiently planned when every Next Action has been decided on every front that can actually be moved on without some other components having to be completed first.\nPart 2 -- Practicing Stress-Free Productivity\nChapter 4 -- Getting Started: Setting Up the Time, Space and Tools\nAllen recommends setting aside two whole days, back to back, to get started.\nTo set up a space, one needs a minimum of a writing surface and room for an in-basket. A work space is needed for work and home for everyone, including students, homemakers and retirees. Donât skimp on the home work space and donât share work space with someone else. Allen is not a proponent of the \"hoteling\" concept that many companies have employed in recent years.\nThe basic processing tools include paper-holding trays, plain paper, post-its, clips, stapler, a labeler all to oneself, letter size file folders (donât bother with color-coding), a calendar, wastebasket/recycling bins, and possibly an organizer to \"manage your triggers externally\" (such as papers, planners or a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)).\nA good general-reference filing system is key to the success of a personal management system. If it takes one more than a minute to get something out of the in-basket, decide it needs no action but should be kept for future reference, and filed, one has a significant improvement opportunity. Key filing success factors include: keep files at handâs reach, use one A to Z alphabetical filing system, have lots of fresh folders, keep the drawers less than three-quarters full, label folders with an Auto Labeler, buy high-quality file cabinets, get rid of hanging files if you can, and purge your files at least once a year.\nChapter 5 -- Collection: Corralling Your \"Stuff\"\nAllen says it usually takes between one and six hours to gather everything that needs to be gathered into oneâs \"in\" basket. Itâs important to complete all the gathering before the \"processing\" and \"organizing\" begins. Although one will be tempted to start the processing while gathering, itâs important not to do so. First, it gives one a sense of just how much stuff there is. Second, the \"end of the tunnel\" is identified. Third, one canât process as effectively with the distraction of knowing there is still more stuff to gather.\nThe gathering process should cover oneâs physical space, such as desk drawers, countertops, and cabinets. It also includes a \"mind sweep\" to uncover anything that may be residing in oneâs mental space, what Allen calls \"psychic RAM\".\nAllen warns that one may feel anxious as all this stuff is made conscious. At the same time, he recommends going for quantity. Finally, once the collection phase is complete, he urges moving on to the next step, since leaving items in the \"in\" box for too long will cause things to creep back into oneâs psyche.\nChapter 6 -- Processing: Getting \"In\" to Empty\nProcessing doesnât mean getting all actions completed; it means deciding what to do with each of the items in the \"in\" box. When this phase is complete, one will have trashed unneeded items, completed any less-than-two-minute actions, delegated, put reminders in oneâs organizer of actions one must complete, and identified any projects.\nAllen provides guidelines for effective processing. First, process the top item first. Resist the urge to pull out the most urgent, fun or interesting item first. Second, process one item at a time. This focus forces the attention and decision-making needed to get through everything. Finally, never put anything back into \"in.\"\nAs each item is reviewed, the key question is, \"whatâs the next action?\" If none, the item is trashed, incubated to a \"Someday/Maybe\" list or \"tickler\" file, or put in reference material. If there is an action, make it specific. Then do it (if it takes less than two minutes), delegate it (and add it to the \"Waiting For\" list) or defer it.\nChapter 7 -- Organizing: Setting Up the Right Buckets\nOnce processing is complete, one needs a way to organize the output. Allen gives the seven primary places to keep output and tips and tricks on making these places work. These areas include: a \"Projects\" list, project support material, calendared actions and information, \"Next Actions\" lists, a \"Waiting For\" list, reference material, and a \"Someday/Maybe\" list. These categories should be kept distinct from each other. Allen states these lists are all that one needs to stay organized and advises against trying to prioritize among these lists. Instead, setting priorities is more of an intuitive process that occurs as lists are reviewed.\nActions that should go on the calendar are ones that must be done on a specific day or time. They may also include triggers for activating projects, events one might want to participate in and decision catalysts. \"Next Actions\" should be organized by context, such as \"Calls\", \"Errands\", and \"At Home.\" The \"Waiting For\" list should be reviewed often enough to determine if one needs to take any action. Items in oneâs \"Read and Review\" pile and emails that require action are reminders themselves, and Allen recommends pulling emails requiring action to a separate folder in oneâs email system.\nThe \"Projects\" list provides a single place to review all projects for needed actions. One may subdivide projects by categories such as Personal/Professional, and one also may identify subprojects. Allen emphasizes there is no perfect way to track projects; one just needs to know what projects they have and how to find any associated reminders. Allen discusses Project Support Materials and warns against using them as a reminder. He also shares ideas for organizing ad hoc project thinking, where ideas are triggered and one needs to capture the ideas.\nAllen makes the point that it is as important to organize nonactionable data -- which includes reference material and \"Someday/Maybes\" -- as it is to manage action and project reminders. Reference systems include general-reference filing, large-category filing, rolodexes and contact managers, and libraries and archives. Most people have 200 to 400 paper-based general-reference files and 30 to 100 e-mail reference folders.\nFor ideas that are not ready for action, one can keep them on a Someday/Maybe list, trigger them on oneâs calendar or put them in a \"tickler\" system. Allen states that it is important not to call the \"Hold and Review\" pile oneâs Someday/Maybe list.\nChapter 8 -- Reviewing: Keeping Your System Functional\nTo keep the system working, it is key that one continues to trust the system. Trust is maintained by keeping the system up-to-date. One needs to decide what to look at and when. Allen suggests the most frequent review will probably be of oneâs daily calendar and daily tickler folder. After these, the next actions lists should be reviewed.\nThe key to sustaining the system is the Weekly Review. This process includes whatever is needed to empty oneâs head and includes going through the five phases of workflow management. Allen recommends blocking out a couple of hours early every Friday afternoon.\nChapter 9 -- Doing: Making the Best Action Choices\nAllen gives three models for deciding what to do at a point in time, beyond his simple answer to trust oneâs intuition.\nThe Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment uses the criteria of context, time available, energy available, and priority to make decisions.\nThe Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work presents Allenâs idea that during a workday, one engages in one of three activities: doing predefined work, doing work as it shows up, or defining oneâs work. Allen asserts that the sacrifice of not doing the work you have defined on your lists, because something else came up, can be tolerated only if one knows what heâs not doing. People may blame their stress and lowered effectiveness on surprises when itâs really their lack of defining their work. He calls oneâs ability to deal with surprise a competitive edge.\nThe Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Own Work is presented in terms of altitude:\n50,000 + feet: Life\n40,000 feet: Three- to five-year visions\n30,000 feet: One-to two-year goals\n20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility\n10,000 feet: Current projects\nRunway: Current actions\nEach of these levels should enhance and align with the levels above it. Priorities are driven from the top. However, without a sense of control over current projects and actions, trying to manage oneself from the top down can create frustration. Allen recommends starting at the bottom level, first ensuring all action lists are complete, and then working up the model.\nChapter 10 -- Getting Projects Under Control\nAllen digs into the \"vertical\" project level again. He indicates that formal planning tools and techniques might be overrated and favors creative, proactive thinking. He suggests projects that may need more planning are first, those that still have oneâs attention even after defining next actions, and second, those for which ideas just show up. The first require a revisit to the Natural Planning Model. The second require tools and structures to capture those random ideas. These may include a good writing instrument, paper, easels and whiteboards, and the computer. Allen states that the very act of writing ideas down facilitates a constructive thinking process like nothing else.\nPart 3 -- The Power of the Key [[Principles]]\nChapter 11 -- The Power of the Collection Habit\nIn this chapter, Allen gets into the psychological aspects of his methodology, which in essence explain why his process works so well. He also discusses the benefits he has observed his clients realize over the years, including an increased level of trust with others and with oneself. He states that people feel badly about their unprocessed \"in\" boxes because the incomplete items in them represent broken agreements with themselves. To remedy this, he advises three choices: donât make the agreement, complete the agreement or renegotiate the agreement.\nHe states that anything held only in \"psychic RAM\" (not conscious) will carry equal weight and many small things will create more mental stress than they deserve. He says that one should use the mind to think about things, rather than of things. He considers his methodology real knowledge work, at a more sophisticated level.\nChapter 12 -- The Power of the Next-Action Decision\nAllen proposes that twenty minutes before the end of a meeting, one should ask, \"So whatâs the next action here?\" to increase clarity. This is radical common sense, yet it is easy to avoid this more relevant level of thinking. He points out the dark side of a \"collaborative culture\" where people are too polite to hold others accountable, but says it is impolite to allow people to walk away from discussions unclear. Asking this question is key for knowledge workers to increase their productivity through \"operational responsiveness.\" Finally, this question presupposes there is the possibility of change and that one can do something to make it happen, which is empowering.\nChapter 13 -- The Power of Outcome Focusing\nAllen says even the slightest increase in the use of natural planning can bring significant improvement. He lauds the ability to envision success when how to achieve it is still unclear. Being able to generate lots of ideas, both good and bad, is a critical piece of creative intelligence. Honing and organizing ideas is a necessary mental discipline. Finally, choosing and taking next actions are the essence of productivity. Effectively applying these techniques is described as perhaps the major component of professional competence for the new millennium.\nDesigned for \"Stress Free Productivity\" \n[[Core Idea]]:\nif you can get all of your commitments out of your head, and into an [[Exo-Brain]] you trust -- tool doesn't matter -- so you know you'll remember the [[task]] exactly when you are in the context where you can work on it -- then you don't have to have a million ideas bouncing around in your head all the time.\n{{[[DONE]]}} find best blog post explaining GTD and link or paste it here\n{{[[DONE]]}} Write up [[Roam for GTD]] with examples #Conor \nBlog series from [[Tiago Forte]]\nKey Terms[[Time Tracking]]\nPart 1\nsource: \nhttps://praxis.fortelabs.co/just-in-time-project-management-a-digital-first-framework-for-modern-projects/ \n[[Key Terms]]\n[[Return-on-Attention]]\n[[Return-on-Investment]]\n[[Project Management]]\n#Quotes\nTechnology has transformed every aspect of business, from the tools we use to communicate and collaborate, to how products and services are built and delivered, to how we conceive of organizations and communities.\nBut it hasnât yet transformed the heart of how we manage and execute work âÂ [[Project Management]] (PM).\nA new paradigm for project management in the digital age has a few requirements:\nDigital-native, not only allowing but assuming that most work will be completed using digital technology and online\nExplicitly enable knowledge workers, who are no longer an exotic curiosity, but the dominant economic force in the world\nThrive in the face of uncertainty and change, not only surviving but excelling in the face of the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) we find ourselves working in every day\nAccommodate any team or organizational structure, adding value regardless of whether a project is being completed by a single freelancer, a team of contractors, across organizational boundaries, or by traditional employees\nLeverage emerging digital technologies, remaining open to and expecting new capabilities to become available regularly\nOperate through and within networks, taking advantage of existing platforms and ecosystems to learn and move faster\nIntegrate deeply with learning, making continuous improvement synonymous with work itself\nAssume remote collaborators, capitalizing on the advantages of distributed teams while neutralizing their disadvantages\nMaximize return-on-attention, explicitly recognizing that attention is our most valuable resource\nThese are the requirements Iâm committed to fulfilling over the course of this series.Â Letâs begin by defining the key metric of Just-In-Time Project Management (JITPM):Â Return-on-Attention.\nThe fall of [[Return-on-Investment]]\nBy the 1950s, American automaker General Motors had become the largest company in the worldÂ¹. Its methods were studied and copied by industrial corporations around the world, becoming the first widespread use of âsystematic management.â\nOf all the new practices that GM developed, the most influential has beenÂ Return-on-InvestmentÂ (abbreviated as [[ROI]]).\nThe logic is straightforward: any given project has a required input (or investment), and an expected output (a return). Weâve all heard that âIt takes money to make money.â By dividing the return by the investment, we getÂ Return-on-Investment, a very simple metric that tells us âwhat came outâ in terms of âwhat went inâ:\n![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148-149.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nIf I invest $10,000 into a project and it returns $11,000, that project had an ROI (Return-on-Investment) of 10% (the profit of $1,000 divided by the original investment of $10,000). It doesnât matter how big or small a project is, how short or long it takes, or how it gets paid back. As long as it can be boiled down to inputs and outputs, we can arrive at a single number called ROI.\n![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/149.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nROI transformed business decision making for one reason: it allowed executives to compare different projects to each other directly.\nThis was extremely important in 1950s America: it was a land of seemingly unlimited abundance and opportunity. Even GM couldnât invest in every project, so it needed a quick but effective method for choosing which ones to commit to at every level of the company.\nBut times have changed, and itâs no longer a matter of picking the lowest hanging fruits in an economy growing by double digits every year. Every industry is hypercompetitive, and opportunities need to be created, not simply chosen. Now we need toÂ nurtureÂ promising projects, products, and situations to profitability.\nBut it takes an incredible amount of sustained attention to see a project through to completion. Especially as we are besieged by distractions on all sides, and new and âbetterâ opportunities seem to come along every five minutes.\nLike time, the supply of attention is finite. But unlike time, we donât automatically get 24 equal units every day. With the rise of social media and freemium business models, our attention is increasingly a resource that can be mined by anyone. If we donât spend it on projects of our own choosing, there are many others all too willing to invest it in their own.\nThe rise of [[Return-on-Attention]]\nROA is the most relevant metric for the digital age, because it recognizes that attention is by far the scarcest resource we possess as knowledge workers.\n![](https://i1.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148-149.002.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nThe impact or success of our work increasingly has nothing to do with how much time or money we spend on it. As industry after industry is âeatenâ by software, they each become âwinner take allâ: a tiny minority who are able to leverage technology get nearly all the exposure and profits, while everyone else can barely make ends meet.\nProjects have becomeÂ non-linearÂ â not simply a sum of the time and dollars spent on them, but complex emergent phenomena we can barely understand or control. Because understanding them takes just as many units of attention as acting on them, it makes more sense to plunge in with exploratory actions, instead of trying to predict what will happen in advance.\nThe question of how to manage projects is now the question of how to optimize the quantity AND quality of the attention we deploy each day. Our success depends on continually finding new sources of leverage, that is, higher and higher âreturnsâ on this attention.\nKnowledge management is project management\nThe challenge of modern work is how to create systems thatÂ free upÂ attention, instead ofÂ consumingÂ more of it.Â \nIn other words, we need systems for managing our attention that produce valueÂ now, not eventually. We canât be âinvestingâ our most valuable asset today in hopes of a distant future that may never come.\nPersonal knowledge management (PKM)Â is the key capability in modern work, because it allows us to continuously make use of attention weâve already deployed. But for it to be viable in the short term, PKM must also be integrated into how we manage day-to-day projects.\nChanging how we manage projectsÂ todayÂ is how we can free up the time and attention to invest in managing our knowledge for tomorrow.\nPart 4\nsource: \nhttps://praxis.fortelabs.co/just-in-time-pm-4-intermediate-packets/\n[[Key Terms]]\n[[Intermediate Packets]]\n[[Intermediate Deliverables]]\n#Quotes\nInÂ [Part 3](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/just-in-time-pm-3-the-scarcity-of-flow-cycles/), I argued that having a personal knowledge base is the linchpin of success in a creative economy.\nA knowledge base allows you to reuse past work, draw from past experiences, share your knowledge in concrete form, and eventually, build products and services out of that knowledge.\nThis requires strategically structuring your work in the first place, as a series of what I callÂ intermediate packets.\n![](https://i1.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1) \n{{[[DONE]]}}  reference in [[Roam for Zettlekasting]]\nInstead of delivering one big lump of value at the very end, you stage your progress in a series of short, intense sprints, ending each one with a tangible, intermediate deliverable, like a set of notes, a brainstorm, a series of examples, an outline, a prototype, or a draft.\nThe first benefit of working this way is thatÂ you become interruption-proof.\nBecause you rarely even attempt to load the entire project into your mind all at once, thereâs not much to âunloadâ if someone interrupts you. Itâs much easier to pick up where you left off, because youâre not trying to juggle all the work-in-process in your head.\n![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.002.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nSecond, you haveÂ more frequent opportunities to get feedback.\nInstead of spending weeks hammering away in isolation, only to discover that you made some mistaken assumptions, you can get feedback at each intermediate stage. You become more adaptable and more accountable, because you are performing your work in public.\n![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.003.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nYou will find that others give much better feedback when they are included early and the work is clearly in draft stage. If itâs too highly polished, theyâll either be afraid to critique it, or get hung up on tiny details.\nThird, you canÂ create value in any span of time.\nIf we see our work as creating these [[Intermediate Packets]], we can find ways to create value in any span of time, no matter how short. Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time (or state of mind, or mood, or energy level) with a corresponding packet that is perfectly suited to it. #[[Maker Schedule]]\n![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.004.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nBy always having a range of packets ready to work on, each one pre-prepared to work on at any time, you can be productive under any circumstances â waiting in the airport before a flight, the doctorâs waiting room, 15 minutes in between meetings.\nFourth,Â big projects become less intimidating.\nBig, ambitious projects feel risky, because all the time you spend on it will feel like a waste if you donât succeed.\nBut if your only goal is to create an intermediate packet and show it to someone â good notes on a book, a Pinterest board of design inspirations, just one module of code â then you can trick yourself into getting started. And even if that particular Big Project doesnât pan out, youâll still have the value of the packets at your disposal!\n![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nFinally, you gain the ability toÂ reuse previously built packets for new projects.\nMaybe some research you did for an online marketing campaign becomes useful for a new campaign. Or some sketches that didnât quite make it into an old design give you inspiration for a new one. Or some book notes you wrote down casually turn out to be very useful for an unforeseen challenge a year later.\n![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nBy incorporating existing packets into new projects, you gain the ability to deliver new projects much faster than seems possible. Eventually, you are able to deliver entire projects just by snapping together existing packets, like Lego pieces. No heavy lifts required.\nWhatâs at stake here is much more than efficiency. Returning to the requirements for flow fromÂ [Part II](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/just-in-time-project-management-the-fundamentals-of-flow/), working in intermediate packets has a positive impact on all six triggers:\n![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.007.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\n1. Clear goals\nItâs much easier to define your goal for a short-term, intermediate packet, than for a long-term project. Shorter term goals are less likely to change, keeping youÂ motivated.\n2. Immediate feedback\nAs I discussed, itâs much easier to get feedback from others on a quick and dirty experiment than on a highly polished final product. Your efforts feel more connected to the impact youâre having on others, which also makes them moreÂ meaningful.\n3. Challenge-skill ratio\nThis refers to the balance between how challenging a [[task]] is, and your skill at performing it. If itâs too hard, youâll give up. But if itâs too easy, youâll get bored. Itâs muchÂ easierÂ to calibrate the challenge of a project versus your skills if itâs smaller and shorter (make a 1-page brief) than if itâs a massive undertaking (launch a mobile app).\n4. Presence of risk\nAs you begin to structure your work as intermediate deliverables, you begin to change the type of risk youâre exposed to. Because you know you can âfreezeâ any deliverable in mid-flight at any time, you no longer fear being interrupted, running out of time, or forgetting the details of what youâre working on. You substitute the risk of not delivering on something large, with the creative risks of going deeper on something small.\n5. Deep embodiment\nAs you offload more and more of your abstract thinking to external tools, new bandwidth begins to open up. This leaves room for noticing your surroundings, the words and actions of others, new sensory experiences, and internal states and bodily sensations. Outsourcing your memory to software frees you up to beÂ presentÂ in the moment. #[[Maker Schedule]]\n6. Rich environment\nThe brain is the ultimate pattern recognizer: it can recognize vastly more than it can recall, so it makes sense to collect interesting patterns to help trigger memories, associations, and new ideas. Starting every project by diving into a rich media library full of pictures, drawings, diagrams, videos, sketches, and mindmaps takes advantage of what the brainÂ engagesÂ with most naturally â visuals.\nBreaking our work into smaller chunks directly creates the conditions for flow. Smaller packets dramatically impact not just theÂ quantity and speedÂ of work we can produce, and not just itsÂ quality, but the actualÂ experienceof producing it. Work becomes more motivating, more meaningful, easier, more impactful, and more engaging. #[[Maker Schedule]]\nImagine if you could create real value in any span of time, under any conditions, with any level of energy or motivation. Because your productivity is not dependent on your state of mind at any given moment. It depends instead on all the knowledge and expertise youâve acquired throughout your life, documented in a personal knowledge base.\nThis is what it looks like to create compounding gains by investing in Knowledge Capital. #[[compound interest]] #[[knowledge banking]]\n![](https://i1.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.008.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\nRelated [[Tiago Debate]]\nRoamans,\nLooking for workflow inspiration?\nWe're finding that some new users who struggled when faced with a blank page instantly 'clicked' once they saw a mature Roam database in action. With that in mind, we're going to send out some example use cases.\nThis week's demo is David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD), which is one of the most popular and venerable productivity systems ever created.\nThe central idea of GDT is to capture and close âopen loopsââto get stray thoughts, to-dos, and concerns out of your head, and pin them to the page for future processing.\nThis frees up mental bandwidth so you're not feeling guilty or overwhelmed, and means you don't have to rely on the memory of your leaky meat-computer.\nAs David Allen says: âYour mind is for having ideas, not holding them.â\nThere are dozens of approaches to implementing GTD, each tailored to a different set of tools and preferences.\nHere's how you can set up a simple GTD-style system in Roam.\n(If you can't see the gifs, select 'display external images' in your webmail client)\nStage 1: Capture\nThe first thing we need is a bucket or in-tray to capture all our ideas and to-dos in one place. In this example, we have a page named GTD pinned to the sidebar for easy access.\nEverything from mundane household chores to wild speculative ideas gets dumped in the all-purpose Bucket at the top of the page:\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2Fh3pjuM2D2HCmu0xd2yn_lLcHgxE4kKdn7glfdY6pmj1j4PfSeVu-QR1Y2wbvv4q4naPLnTKgdZGdZ7a5xivLthtTRAT39G_NI00Fhp58_bOpIutdSK6lvmnw0jzOyLW2R0zUVUB_)\nStage 2: Processing\nNext, we have to choose a frequency to clean out the bucketâsay, at the end of each workday, or every Mon/Wed/Fri.\nWhile processing the contents of the bucket, we ask ourselves: what is this thing, and what should I do with it next?\nThis gives us three broad courses of action:\n1. Ignore it\nSome items in the bucket may have already resolved themselves, or no longer seem like they're worth holding onto. Go ahead and delete them.\nIf an item isn't associated with an actionable task, but is a valuable note, idea, or piece of information, you can add it to your [Zettelkasten](https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/VURQiVZQR) or other note-taking system (we'll explore this in future emails).\n2. Do it now\nDavid Allen's rule of thumb is that if you can process the next actionable step of any bucket item in 2 minutes, you might as well do it right now. Otherwise, you're spending more time storing and tracking it than it would take to deal with on the spot.\nTwo minutes is only a guideline: if you have a longer window to empty your bucket, you could extend it to 5 or 10 minutes.\nIn this example, we delete our 3am thought, which no longer seems so brilliant in the cold light of day (Option 1: Ignore it).\nWe also buy the Gervais Principle book and send the expense tracker template to Cso, both of which take less than 2 minutes, and check them off right away. (Option 2: Do it now).\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2FFq3GrFGVvO2IXsKgTtJSl3xBuIQE8U5H1MWge7V5-02Zo4yghZqqZbeA1vqqWDlfgspM2mWbr7oNMCOFa3qvcslDzwTNiftPK52prC3Nj14FUPcJ_-mrNNhiYROuS0dO2rkD8-sh)\n3. Defer it\nThe tasks that can't be deleted or completed on the spot need to be assigned to a project container, and scheduled if necessary.\nBeneath our catch-all bucket on the GTD page, we have containers for all our ongoing projects: Personal, Financial, Notes and Reviews, etc.\nIn this example, we make 'Import Deep Dish changelog into Roam' into a to-do, and then drag it into the #CURRENT section of the relevant project container.\nTip: You can make to-dos with the slash autocomplete, hitting Cmd+Enter, or by right-clicking on a bullet.\nNext, we move 'Apply for AMEX card on next trip home' into the Financial container, but we don't make it into a to-do. It's not actionable any time soon, so we nest it under the #LATER-SOMEDAY subheading instead:\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2F0cqgrVlUztRBG8x2JbS6Yaa5m8b4LXJXJfJxYZDGhQCnEZIRrbMjVMj4smrwcnjcs6WQ_jtMil5n69m8_onDF3aRqCa5bpSsDx4eyhIehfQm4ePmI4yuXcvXVWEUbjbinNYT38is)\nYou don't have to keep your GTD project containers on the same page, but it's handy to be able to see everything in one place.\nMake it atomic\nWhile emptying the bucket, it's important to make sure each of our tasks has a clearly defined next actionable step.\nThe last item in our bucket, 'Caribbean coast planning', is too vague, so we break it down into its component tasks and convert them into individual to-dos:\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2FqOl37XwhZnCwNYHES2rZ0WpSt0ipJywYqAvP9oXsEM11bhskWU-mjCQG6DTD3P2vUtInoE-IS_9kicNzJXWhvX29J8HnesRj0vYXvyoa4UO9V0JADoGmrI4kW4ft21eHrzCHOFaY)\nThere's no need to get atomic for the hazy ideas that we're dumping in the #LATER-SOMEDAY section. The key distinction here is that we only assign a to-do checkbox to a clearly defined action.\nScheduling\nWe can either assign a priority/deadline to a task now, or later on in Stage 3.\nIn this simple example, we divide each project container into two sections: one for #CURRENT tasks, and #LATER-SOMEDAY, for ideas and projects we want to incubate for a while.\nWe can then simply drag and drop the nested to-dos into order of priority.\nA second approach is to add tags, like #urgent or #this week, so we can see all our high-priority tasks one one page (and pin it to the sidebar).\nAnd a third approach is to use the Datepicker in the slash autocomplete menu to assign a due date or deadline, which creates a backlink to the relevant daily log page:\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2FaHDDRowtZlmCWu7KeMZiTTj9v3h6KG_D6Uy46BwSLm3dBC3dz_pMWoA52-zupNcyU-Q3JCdXcfjDbip-XKQfDDFGUeY6kJ5Iz8TKfh5ee1HO3fb46HOO6zpaysSLOngGA2oW0Xoi)\nStage 3: Reflection\nThis is the time we set aside to clear our heads, and look at the big-picture overview of all our current and future projects.\nDavid Allen calls this the Weekly Review. You can do it twice weekly, or fortnightly, or whatever is the right frequency for you.\nIt starts with an empty bucket, so clear any items that haven't been processed yet. Now we can go through each of our project containers, check off any completed to-dos, and assign the tasks we're going to tackle this week (again, using tags or the datepicker).\nThis is also our opportunity to look over anything we've dumped in the #LATER-SOMEDAY section, and see if it's ripe for action yet. If so, we might give it its own project container, break it down into component tasks, or assign a to-do checkbox to the next actionable step:\n\t\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F4t-fL0KwqK8gbh0GlNHOR-WxoGzWw4nFggjSvVx8VYt7_8_8j8MfFxF8Udh2JboarA1IRdlKtNqE4WaGRys2v9PRjhMElovHTObWG3Jt7C7VhCCmp0bkN0Yq3tI_5CL9LRyvXrKt)\nWhy use Roam for GTD?\nThe main advantage of bringing your task management system into Roam is that you can integrate workflows with all your ongoing writing projects, research, contacts, and Zettelkasten practice.\nAny to-do you assign is bidirectionally linked to the people, dates, and projects involved, so you can see it in the mentions of each relevant page. You can then filter your list of to-dos by project, person, date, urgency, and any other attribute you care to add.\nYou can also filter out 'DONE' tasks without having to delete them, so the history of your accomplishments is only ever a couple of clicks away:\n![](https://media.superhuman.com/images/_/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F9JKfXOQHommnj5iL-E0DS_PwzC4V7Mfuj6IatFWlhEASBcI-Aj6zfEnu7YU3ITNMhdhldrjYlkxo6xuyZkQpKjr6jZZHGERWZ7kOnZ58ikhx-qnBEDjjwPou5JgzBA7lSxMdMOoH)\nDavid Allen's driving mission was to show us how to get open loops out of our heads and into a system, and to break down vague intentions into atomic 'next actionable steps'.\nWe're finding that Roam works as a collection bucket for just about anythingâto-dos, conversations, notes, half-baked ideasâwhile the outliner structure of nested bullets naturally encourages atomic thinking.\nFurther reading[[\"Check out the updated version of David Allen's book: \" \"[Getting Things Done: the Art of Stress-Free Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280)\"]]\nThere are also plenty of [summaries](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done:_The_Art_of_Stress-Free_Productivity) [available](https://joshkaufman.net/getting-things-done/) online.\nHere's the classic GTD system in [flowchart form](https://flow-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GTD-Flowchart-654x1024.jpg).\nWe're aiming to send out a few more use cases in the coming weeks, so let us know if there's something you'd especially like to see.

Roam is an online workspace for organizing and evaluating knowledge. The system is built on a directed graph, which frees it from the constraints of the classic file tree. Users can remix and connect ideas in multiple overlapping hierarchies, with each unit of information becoming a node in a dynamic network. Any given node can occupy multiple positions simultaneously, convey information through defined relationships, and populate changes throughout the graph. With weightings assigned to the strength of relationships between nodes, Roam also becomes a tool for Bayesian inference and decision making. The ultimate goal is to extend the system to collaborative reasoning, allowing groups to build shared mental maps and make faster and better-informed decisions.\nTable of contents\n((1498))\n((30_t6vp-x))\n((1504))\n((1508))\n((1514))\n((1534))\n((1535)) \n((1540))\n((1551))  \n((1557))\n((1559))\n((1564))\n((1567))\n((2Vw3Pbr6L))  \n((1586))\n((1593))\n((1604))\n**1.    Introduction**\nWe are experiencing an unprecedented explosion of knowledge. Every day, 2700 books are published in the United States alone, 6850 scientific papers are authored, more than 2 million blog posts go live, and 294 billion emails fly back and forth. The amount of total data produced with every rotation of the Earth would fill a stack of books stretching to the moon and back. [1](((CUDrvnqeF))) While this exponential growth presents enormous opportunities for individuals and society at large, neither the human brain nor current technologies are equipped to harness it to its full potential.\n**2.   Current approaches to knowledge management**\nHumans are poorly adapted to the Information Age, which has arisen only in the last ~0.02% of our evolutionary history. While the brain does have a remarkable capacity for raw storage, probably in the range of several petabytes,[2](((fovwPihLc))) it is infamously fallible in processing information. Memory retrieval is lossy and unreliable, while many of our hardwired cognitive biases and heuristics misfire in the modern world, distorting our perception, judgement and decision-making ability. The plasticity of the brain enables it to rewire itself with new connections, but even this is a âuse it or lose itâ feature, causing neglected neural pathways to atrophy.\nMany technologies for organizing knowledge outside of the brain have arisen in response to these limitations. Physical books and journals proliferated after the invention of the Gutenberg Press, and have since been partially supplanted by word processors, websites, blogs, forums, wikis, and software applications.\nWhile we are presented with a plethora of choices for organizing knowledge, almost every technology follows the same basic âfile cabinetâ format: A unit of knowledge is saved to a certain file path, which places it within a taxonomy of folders, chapters or categories. Tags may be applied when an item relates to many things, but each file is generally only stored within one nested hierarchy. To access the information, the user must remember where they stored the file, what they tagged it with, or use a search function to locate it.\nRelated Twitter Thread\nhttps://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1099181050045952006\n**3.   Problems with the file cabinet approach**\nIn some regards, current technologies remain vastly inferior to the human brain. If each neuron only held a single âunitâ of memory in this manner, our brains would quickly fill to overflowing. Instead, information is conveyed in the connections between neurons and neural networks, so a common idea can be made available across the entire brain; the concept of a blue sky might be used in countless seemingly discrete memories of time spent outdoors. This efficiency helps to explain why a computer requires several million times more energy to perform the same tasks as a human brain (which runs on about as much power as a dim light bulb).[3](((D7lW-q9tj)))\nUnlike the brain, the file cabinet approach makes it difficult or impossible to remix or reuse the same piece of information. Each time a change is made to any given file, it has to be tracked down and updated in every location in which it exists. This leads to redundancy, with a cluttering of near-identical ideas, and significant work any time a system-wide change is required.\nCurrent solutions also lack interconnectivity. Many files are divorced from context; cast into a drawer, rather than methodically fitted into a broader framework of knowledge. Knowledge trees can create pseudo-relationships between files nested within a given hierarchy, but these are not explicit, and can only describe a vertical âparent and childâ taxonomy. Some tools, such as web pages and wikis, also allow for orthogonal linking between related files, but this takes place in an ad hoc fashion, and again, there is no ability to explicitly define relationships.\n**4.\tKnowledge graphs as nodal networksÂ **\nLarge-scale collaboration requires a more flexible data structure than the classic file tree. Roam is built on a knowledge graph that maps all possible relationships, with âsmartâ links between defined concepts. Users can connect similar ideas in multiple overlapping hierarchies, remix them without overwriting the original context, and selectively share parts of the graph with others to collaborate on specific sub-questions.\nIf current tools resemble filing cabinets, Roam is more akin to the nodal networks in telecommunications, or the neurons in the human brain. Rather than existing in a vacuum, each note or file becomes a node in an interconnected graph of ideas. A single node may simultaneously hold positions in several different sequences, hierarchies or file paths, and can âtalkâ to other nodes, communicating information back and forth about the nature of each relationship. The network is dynamic, so updates and revisions are populated across the entire graph simultaneously. Individual nodes or branches within the network can be forked as required, allowing a new pathway to deviate without changing the original meaning.\nAt the simplest level, Roamâs structure makes it inherently easier to store, recall, and cross-reference ideas. This is the primary proposition for students, writers, self-directed learners, and users of existing note-taking apps.  \nFor power users, the knowledge graph also unlocks applications in logic and reasoning, Bayesian inference and decision-making, modelling complex problems, and collaborative research.\nThese features are explored in Chapters 5 - 8, along with potential use cases for the technology.Â \n**5.\tDependency graphs and logical reasoning**\nEverything from peer-reviewed research papers to the opinion pages of a newspaper are based on formulating arguments that support a certain premise, along the lines of the following:Â \nIf A is true, then B is true.\nIf C and D are both true, then A is true.\nC and D are true.\nTherefore, B is true.\nExample:: [[Precise Links]]\n{{embed:((PWRiHAsEv)) }}\nOften, C and D will be supported by links to external articles, where they are conclusions reached by larger arguments based on combining other premises. Unfortunately, the structure of the argument is only implied by the prose. Rarely are the relationships between arguments and pieces of evidence explicitly laid out, except perhaps in the notes of the author investigating the claims.\nRoam allows individual researchers or writers to organize all the claims they wish to make across a number of different projects. It also creates opportunities for large-scale interdisciplinary research projects. When teams of interested collaborators have an agreed-upon structure for formatting arguments and counterarguments, it is possible to create expandable user interfaces which âbubble upâ insight from claims which require expertise, to ones that are more easily understood by laypersons.\nThe ambiguity of natural language derails many discussions. Unless [[terms]] are clearly defined from the outset, any form of argument is futile, and will often end up entrenching the initial positions of the interlocutors.\nExample A\nAlice:Â  \"A tree falling in a deserted forest makes a sound.\"\nBob:Â  \"A tree falling in a deserted forest does not make a sound.\"\nExample B\nAlice:Â  \"A tree falling in a deserted forest [generates acoustic vibrations].\"\nBob:Â  \"A tree falling in a deserted forest does not [generate auditory experiences].\" {{alias: ((1597)) 4}}\nWhile these positions are contradictory as expressed in Example A, simply defining the term âsoundâ reveals the underlying beliefs are entirely compatible.Â \nThe ability to use clearly defined sets within a dependency graph helps to resolve ambiguity, reducing the chances of participants talking at cross-purposes, or deliberate âmotte-and-baileyâ style strategic equivocation.{{alias: ((1598)) 5}}\nBesides reasoning and argument, dependency graphs have applications in education, self-directed learning, and general decision-making. Even a very complicated project can be traced backwards to a number of smaller [[task]]s. The user can see the tradeoffs involved in each pathway, map out which route is the fastest, and which path might bring them closer to other interesting goals. As the student marks their progress, they can discover new projects and pathways which make use of the skills they have acquired.\nThe problems of prose apply even in the domain of mathematical proofs, see Lamportâs [[How to write a 21st Century Proof]]â\n**6.\tUntangling complexity**\n**6.1\tNonlinear causality**\nSimple problems often follow a straightforward causal path. When a patient has a range of symptoms strongly associated with the flu, the doctor might conclude from the observable variables that there is one invisible variable - the influenza virus. Treat that latent variable, and the symptoms disappear.Â \nScott Alexander observes that his peers in psychiatry similarly try to attribute a collection of linked symptoms to a latent variable; for example, depression. {{alias: ((1599)) 6}} However, the symptoms âcausedâ by depression - e.g. sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt - can also have a causal effect on one another, and on the disorder itself. This complex web of relationships, which may include feedback loops, does not follow a path of linear causality. For complicated problems of this nature, nodal networks are a much more accurate model:\nA model of major depression (MD) and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) by Nuijten, Deserno, Cramer, and Borsboom.{{alias: ((1600)) 7}} The disorders roughly map onto clusters of symptoms that are often found together and reinforce one another, but there is no clear âbright lineâ between the conditions.\nEven at face value, a nodal network provides a visual aid to problem-solving - a birdâs eye view of the connections between various elements. This may help to identify patterns or clusters which may be counterintuitive or entirely invisible when each piece of the puzzle is examined at the object level.\n**6.2\tBayesian reasoning**\nApplying Bayesian reasoning to the knowledge graph makes it a powerful tool for estimating probabilities, testing hypotheses, and making decisions. Bayesâ Theorem is a law of probability that tells us how much we should change our minds about something when we learn a new fact or acquire new evidence. The theorem is stated in the following equation:\n\n        $$P(A|B) =  {P(B|A) P(A) \\over P(B)}$$ \n\nwhere A is the proposition of interest, B is the observed evidence, P(A) and P(B) are prior probabilities, and P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A.\nSuppose a doctor has a patient who is worried about carrying a latent disease, because he belongs to an at-risk group. This is the âproposition of interestâ on the left side of the equation. Prior data suggests 4% of the general population are carriers, so $$P(A) = 0.04$$. B is the observed evidence, which is that 32% of the general population are members of the at-risk group. $$P(B) = 0.32$$. The doctor knows that among patients who do carry the disease, 80% belong to the at-risk group: $$B|A = 0.8$$.\nThe doctor applies Bayesâ theorem:\n$$P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.04)/0.32$$\n$$P(A|B) = 0.1$$\nHer patient only has a one in 10 chance of being a carrier - which might be less than expected, given that almost all carriers are members of the at-risk group.Â \nWhile this is a simple calculation, the strength of Bayesian reasoning is that it breaks down seemingly insurmountable problems into small pieces. Even where no data are available, successive layers of estimates can still provide useful refinements to the confidence levels of various outcomes. By incorporating this framework into the defined relationships between nodes, revisions to the weightings at any point in the network will automatically populate throughout the knowledge graph.\nBayesian probability also provides a framework for decision-making. By estimating the costs and tradeoffs of various options, users can calculate which pathway provides the highest expected value. Again, the quality of the decisions can be refined by successive layers of evidence for and against, even when the weightings are simple estimates of personal preference. An evaluation matrix allows someone to integrate a great deal of information into the final decision, rather than defaulting to simple heuristics.\n{{[[TODO]]}} [Example [[Diagrams]] of decision tree/matrix] \n**7.\tOptimising for serendipity**\nJust as humans are incapable of generating random numbers, we struggle to consciously generate random ideas - to the point where actively trying to âthink differentlyâ often seems to only further calcify existing patterns. Instead of attempting to brute-force creativity, the brain must be confronted with novel stimuli in order to reorganize its perception. Exposure to a certain amount of random ânoiseâ - drugs, dreams, meditation, Tarot readings, mistakes - can jolt thoughts out of well-tracked grooves and into entirely new areas of idea-space. Typically these insights occur at the juncture of two or more seemingly unrelated fields, concepts, or images. \nThe interconnectivity of the Roam knowledge graph constantly creates opportunities for serendipity to blossom. Each node in the network can be viewed in several graphical displays, allowing users to see related ideas, scan up and down the vertical hierarchy, examine nearby clusters of nodes, and observe patterns.Â \nThe Roam search function can be calibrated to include as much or as little ânoiseâ as the user desires. While looking for a specific passage or note, search is narrow enough to find exactly what the user has in mind. However, it can also be broadened out for âfishing tripsâ aimed at surfacing categories of ideas. Some search results will consist of notes that the user might otherwise have forgotten about, some will be noise, and others will spark ideas the user didnât even know they were looking for.\nThe synthesis and cross-pollination of ideas from diverse fields presents low-hanging fruit for both individuals and society. The investment of time and effort required to become a specialist quickly runs into a point of diminishing returns. By contrast, accumulating a âtalent stackâ of dilettante-level knowledge or skills can unlock insights and opportunities that have not been capitalised on by experts with a narrower focus.\nHighly specialised knowledge remains essential for opening new frontiers. However, an interdisciplinary approach is often required to solve the increasingly complex problems faced by scientists, technologists, and policymakers.\n**8.    Collaborative problem-solving**\nWhile the individual use case for Roam stands on its own merits, the ultimate goal is to create a platform for collaborative research and learning. Current protocols are bound by the assumption of necessary consensus. The flexibility of a curated knowledge graph allows for a more pluralistic approach, with the ability to weight conflicting opinions and separate signal from noise without resorting to either autocracy or democracy.Â \n8.1\t**Finding signal in the noise**\nAs the frequency of information increases, the world becomes noisier and noisier. Deliberate exposure to noise is a useful strategy in specific contexts, as described in Chapter 7,Â  but otherwise obscures meaning. {{alias: ((1601)) 8}} Given we have a propensity for imposing stories and explanations onto randomness - the narrative fallacy - it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate out genuine signal from noise.Â \nAssume a trend has a signal-to-noise ratio of 1:1 on an annual basis (50% of the data are meaningful, 50% are random). Observing the same data on a daily basis, the composition changes to 95% noise, 5% signal. Observing the data hourly (as news hounds and market junkies do), and it becomes 99.5% random - which is to say, two hundred times more noise than signal. {{alias: ((1602)) 9}}\nInstitutions entrusted with interpreting the data include the media, academia, and legislature. Some agents within these institutions deliberately obscure the truth, as demonstrated by âfake newsâ, p-hacking, and politicking. While actively malicious behaviour is the exception, even the best-intentioned reporters, researchers and analysts are not immune to being fooled by randomness.\nFor most people, the problem of sorting signal from noise therefore involves finding trustworthy and accurate secondary sources of information. This difficult [[task]] is often frustrated by gated scientific journals, as well as search engine algorithms increasingly gamed by SEO-savvy content marketers.\n8.2\t**Redundancy**\nNavigating a vast sea of information creates massive redundancy. Most people labour away at problems that have already been solved a million times over. Those who tackle unsolved problems often do so in silos, unaware of each otherâs existence. All the pieces of any given puzzle may be present, but no one individual or group holds them all. The wheel is reinvented over and over again, in endless forums and comments sections and web pages and books that burst into existence and fade just as quickly to obscurity.\nThe goal of Roam is to enable systematic curation and collaboration on a large scale. Users will be able to selectively share parts of their graphs publicly, or with circles of peers and colleagues. In turn, they will be able to follow the work of persons they trust, whether they be domain experts or enthusiastic amateurs. Those looking to acquire specific knowledge can turn immediately to trusted sources, and set alerts to receive updates about new pieces of information pertaining to an area of interest.\n8.3\t**Dispensing with necessary consensus**\nAlmost every medium today presents knowledge as though it were the last word; assuming both a necessary consensus and an uncomposable page. Wikipedia is one of the great wonders of the Internet age, but it makes both of these mistakes. There can only be one article on any subject for any given language, and the only connection between pages is through links, with no article \"built\" off another.\nBy way of contrast, consider Github: Libraries are built on other libraries, and functions are built from other functions. Developers build tools that others can build upon to build ever more impressive tools. Most of the modern web is built on open-source technologies, which would not have been possible if programmers followed the old protocols for intellectual collaboration.\nMany problems can be solved by writing code, but natural language is still the way we determine which problems are worth solving. Natural language is how we explain the world to one another, and communicate our models of reality. It is the language of education. It is the language of decision-making. That language needs a toolchain for collaboration that is just as good as the one for managing code.\n8.4\t**Against autocracy; against democracy**\nThe problem of necessary consensus is resolved by individuals or groups assembling their own graph of inferences, based on premises or data curated from their trusted networks. However, collaboration still requires a mechanism for evaluating which ideas are best. In the same way that individuals assign weightings to their personal predictions and decisions,Â  groups must be able to âvoteâ on the merits of any given idea, premise, or piece of evidence. There are various options for how these collective weightings might be calibrated, some of which are briefly described below.\na) **Wisdom of crowds**\nA diverse collection of people can make certain decisions and predictions much better than any given individual: The great statistician Francis Galton was stunned to find that 800 people guessing the weight of an ox at a country fair returned an average that was just one pound shy of the correct figure of 1198 pounds.Â \nIn other situations, the opinion of the crowd bears little relationship to objective reality. By definition, the tyranny of the majority will quash any position that is unpopular, regardless of whether it is true. Often, domain-specific knowledge may be required; for example, someone who has not studied free will would only be adding noise by âvotingâ a preference for compatibilism, hard determinism, or libertarianism.Â \nSimple popularity contests do not always move us closer to the truth, but they are useful in that they tell us what we believe. This data could potentially be broken down by demographic to demonstrate how different groups perceive reality, and possibly alert users to biases amongst their own in-groups.\nb) **Believability scores**\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio pioneered a decision-making system at Bridgewater Associates that is much closer to epistocracy than democracy: The opinions of more âbelievableâ people, who have repeatedly proven their grasp of a given topic or trait, hold more weight than those with lower believability scores. There is nothing to stop Dalio being overruled by his most junior employees, as long are they are consistently more right than he is. Implementing a similar system in Roam would necessitate the ability to track performance, perhaps by how much original content a user has contributed to the graph with broad support, or how well-calibrated their predictions are.\nc) **Prediction markets**\nWhen people succumb to peer pressure and other biases, do not have enough specialist knowledge, or deliberately make false predictions, the âwisdom of the crowdâ can end up being very wrong.\nThe insight behind prediction markets is that participants can be incentivised to profit from any such mistakes. Wherever someone believes the consensus is wrong, they can stake money on it, and move the probability back to a better informed position. Insider information is not only permitted, but welcomed. In this way, vast amounts of information can be synthesised into one constantly updated data point, which is often remarkably accurate.\nThe uptake and growth of prediction markets has been dampened by regulatory issues, but possible workarounds include a non-fiat token, or reputation-linked points system.\n**9.    Conclusion**\nThe project of human knowledge, as it stands today, is a vast ocean of ephemeral and fragmented information and ideas, much of it inaccurate, some of it malicious, with the best sources either restricted by gatekeepers, or near-impossible to locate. The volume of information is growing exponentially, which promises enormous opportunities if the underlying coordination problems can be resolved.\nClearly a fundamentally different approach is required. The Roam vision for human knowledge is a collective, open-source intelligence, constantly rearranging, iterating and evolving in the pursuit of truth.Â  Each of us would become a node within this collective intelligence, forging links and creating networks, sharing the very best each has to offer, improving ourselves even as we improve others, and advancing the interests of humanity as a whole.\nAbout Roam\nRoam was founded by Conor White-Sullivan and Joshua Brown. Conor has been working on tools for collective intelligence for more than nine years, founding the online town common Localocracy (acquired by AOL in 2011) then leading R&D for Huffington Post following the acquisition. Conor and Josh met at 42.us.org, a tuition-free coding university, where Josh placed in the top five of the first 1000 cadets to enter the US program during the month-long application exam. This white paper was co-authored by business journalist Richard Meadows, whose trial of early prototypes led him to become the first investor in Roam.\nThe Roam stack:\nReact\nClojure and Clojurescript\nDatalog\nContact Conor at cwhitesullivan@gmail.com with any enquiries.\nNotes and references\n[1] At least 2.5 quintillion bytes of information are produced every day, which is about the same amount as was produced during the entire year of 2002.Â \n[2] Scientific American: New Estimate Boosts the Human Brain's Memory Capacity 10-Fold.\n[3] Microelectronics pioneer Carver Mead, who coined the term Mooreâs Law, correctly predicted in 1990 that present-day computers would use ten million times more energy for a single instruction than the brain uses for a synaptic activation.\n[4] This example is adapted from the Less Wrong sequence 37 Ways Words Can be Wrong.\n[5] Motte-and-bailey refers to arguing an easy-to-defend and often common-sense statement (the motte), in order to ward off critics from a hard-to-defend and more controversial statement (the bailey).

Our organizations are characterized like never before by job-hopping, mergers and acquisitions, layoffs and reorganizations, outsourcing and automation, harsh competitive environments and even harsher startup ecosystems. Meanwhile, the number of freelancers, online businesses, and independent contractors is exploding.\nFor our purposes, all these trends have an important impact: the [[Average Employee Tenure]] is plummeting (to just 2.3 years for employees ages 20â34, as of a few years ago). I believe this means that the relative importance of ânon-actionable informationâ is rising. We can now expect to spend only a few months to a few years with one organization, which means our ability to capture, organize, and retrieve our ideas, and transfer them effectively from project to project and company to company, becomes more important than ever.\nIn 2015, David Allen published anÂ [updated edition (affiliate link)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KWG9M2E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fortelabs07-20&linkId=0ed3b8962b0204141b76718a44889651&language=en_US)Â ofÂ Getting Things DoneÂ that sheds light on this trend. Littered throughout the book are tantalizing hints of what Allen sees as the future of GTD, and of productivity: what he calls an âintegrated total life-management system.â\nAgain and again, he hammers on the critical importance of âa good general-reference fileâ as âone of the biggest bottlenecks in implementing an efficient personal management system.â He emphasizes that, âFor most of the executives I have coached, it represents one of the biggest opportunities for improvement.â\nHe goes on to explain that, although these materials are âseldom associated with urgency, nor are they strategicâ¦â, if left unmanaged âyour mental and physical workspaces become cluttered with non-actionable but potentially relevant and useful stuff.â This lack of effective downstream systems, he claims, eventually produces a âdebilitating psychological noiseâ that makes any kind of creative thinking impossible. Weâve all been there.\nâIf you donât have a good system for storing bad ideas, you probably donât have one for filing good ones,Â either.â -- [[David Allen]] #Quotes\nIn an economy driven by creativity and innovation, not having a personal knowledge management (PKM) system means youâre not fully leveraging what you learn. Youâre not collecting your ideas and making serendipitous connections between them. Youâre not offloading your best thinking onto reliable tools, freeing your conscious mind to focus on creating novel value. You are in danger of becoming what Ben Horowitz warns against in his bookÂ The Hard Thing About Hard Things: a âcontent-freeâ employee.\nAllen goes on to lay out many of the qualities such a reference system should have:\n#Quotes [[David Allen]]\nâYou will resist the whole process of capturing information if your reference systems are notÂ fast, functional, and fun.â\nâThe great thing about external brainstorming is that in addition toÂ capturing your original ideas, it canâ¦continuallyÂ reflect them back to you.â\nâThere must beÂ zero resistanceÂ to using the systems we have.â\nââ¦the ease of capturing and storing has generated a write-only syndrome: all theyâre doing is capturing informationââânot actuallyÂ accessing and using it intelligently.â\nâWe need to have a way to overview our mass of collected information with some form ofÂ effective categorization.â\nBut this new frontier presents a challenge: the world of non-actionable informationâââlong-term, asynchronous, open-ended research on creative projectsâââis very murky, with no âclean edgesâ or ânext physical actionsâ to speak of. It is not at all clear at the outset what a piece of information means, how it will be used, how important it is, or even what category it falls into. And the more creative and the more interests one has, the worse this problem gets.\nCreating a system of personal knowledge management is a design problem. And like all design problems, it must balance and trade off multiple priorities against each other: the balance between [[Order]] and [[Serendipity]]; between being goal-directed and allowing our thinking to lead us to unexpected places; between supporting our existing viewpoints and challenging us with new ones. Such a system needs to help us cultivate what Roger Martin called an opposable mindâââthe ability to hold two opposing ideas in our mind at the same timeâââwithout taxing our ability to actually get things done. #Trade-Offs #Roam\nAllen notes that âSoftwareÂ is now available that allows capturing and categorizing this kind of information (and synchronizing it with multiple devices), but it does require some thought about how toÂ structureÂ it, as well as someÂ directed behaviorÂ to flow this kind of stuff into appropriate places instead of complicating and confusing your digital environment.â\n#facts\n((2057))\n14:11\n[[Questions]]\nIs it worthwhile to put public thoughts in this help database?\n((1312))\nHey Writer,\nHere are a few things you might find helpful\n[[Document Mode]]\nIf you want your writing to look more like a page than a bulleted list you can right click the page title and select view as document\n:imghttps://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2FScreenshot%202019-08-13%2020.09.23.png?alt=media&token=c4cc9324-1c97-4029-bf1f-b6d0a1f93002\nCreating headers\nYou can create headers with key commands or by right clicking on a bullet point\nwith key command\nIf you hit `command-alt-1`you can get a header\nThis is a header\nif you hit `command-alt-2` you get a subheader\nThis is a subheader\nif you hit `command-alt-3` you get a sub-sub-header\nthis is subsubheader\nWith right click\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2Fi9xi_o4WJa?alt=media&token=0e87c87c-ef5a-4dd5-9b02-54d3d49d9e15)\nThat is also where you can change the alignment of a piece of text if you want to center something\nWhen there is a whole subsection I may want to change, but not throw out the draft I use `command ,` to create version control on a block\nstoring quotes\nI like to create a page for [[Quotes]]\nWhen I'm reading an article, or exported my highlights I paste things under a heading for quotes so it shows up in the mentions, and tag them with the relevant topic\nWhen I'm writing, I'll often just put the quotes in via a `block mention` like such\n((1962))\nVersion control on words\nif I'm searching for the right {{or: term | phrase | word}}, and I don't want to break flow while drafting, I'll use an or block like such to show the options I'm considering for the word\n`{or: term a | term b | term c}`\nVersion control on subsections\nOption 1\nI like to use {{word-count}} along with a [[Morning Pages]] habit, of trying to write 750 words per day\nWord count will count all the words in a block and all the words nested underneath\nFor a person trying to use roam for writing, here are some handy todos to get you started #[[Example]]\n{{[[TODO]]}} Learn to use version control in Roam\nhit `command ,` to version control this block\nclick the number button to show tabs for your different versions\n{{[[TODO]]}} Make an {{or: word selection | or block | word choice}} in Roam\n{{[[TODO]]}} Keep track of words with `word-count` {{word-count}} \n{{[[TODO]]}} use the Mentions feature to collect some thoughts on a topic\n{{[[TODO]]}} paste some of your existing writing in -- and use \"the unlinked references to see if you've written about the same idea in many of your old notes\n{{[[TODO]]}}  make some of those references explicit using tags\n{{[[TODO]]}} make some of those references explicit using links\nNote on ((2380)) and ((2381)) -- tags and links work the same way, tags are just for single word pages, and are a little less visually obtrusive\n{{[[TODO]]}} use block-references to embed the same paragraph in multiple documents -- useful for quotes\n01:05\nAdded to [[What People Are Saying]]\n02:21 -

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive [[task]] of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on \"The American Scholar,\" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. â THE EDITOR\nThis article appears in the July 1945 issue.\nThis has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership. Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end. What are the scientists to do next?\nFor the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there can be little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to leave the old paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives remain much the same.\nIt is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated assignments. They have done their part on the devices that made it possible to turn back the enemy, have worked in combined effort with the physicists of our allies. They have felt within themselves the stir of achievement. They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.\n1\nOf what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence? First, they have increased his control of his material environment. They have improved his food, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence. They have given him increased knowledge of his own biological processes so that he has had a progressive freedom from disease and an increased span of life. They are illuminating the interactions of his physiological and psychological functions, giving the promise of an improved mental health.\nScience has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.\nThere is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workersâconclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.\nProfessionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose. If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works and in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts of time might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.\nThe difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.\nBut there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities come into use. Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical sense, advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what is not, thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under the guidance of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings, cathode ray tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by comparison a microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will carry out involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human operator and thousands of times as fastâthere are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.\nTwo centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent breakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that time and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.\nBabbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.\nMachines with interchangeable parts can now be constructed with great economy of effort. In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably. Witness the humble typewriter, or the movie camera, or the automobile. Electrical contacts have ceased to stick when thoroughly understood. Note the automatic telephone exchange, which has hundreds of thousands of such contacts, and yet is reliable. A spider web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow, in short, the thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million, tossed about in packages, plugged into socketsâand it works! Its gossamer parts, the precise location and alignment involved in its construction, would have occupied a master craftsman of the guild for months; now it is built for thirty cents. The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it.\n2\nA record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. Today we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic wires. Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.\nCertainly progress in photography is not going to stop. Faster material and lenses, more automatic cameras, finer-grained sensitive compounds to allow an extension of the minicamera idea, are all imminent. Let us project this trend ahead to a logical, if not inevitable, outcome. The camera hound of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 10 beyond present practice. The lens is of universal focus, down to any distance accommodated by the unaided eye, simply because it is of short focal length. There is a built-in photocell on the walnut such as we now have on at least one camera, which automatically adjusts exposure for a wide range of illumination. There is film in the walnut for a hundred exposures, and the spring for operating its shutter and shifting its film is wound once for all when the film clip is inserted. It produces its result in full color. It may well be stereoscopic, and record with two spaced glass eyes, for striking improvements in stereoscopic technique are just around the corner.\nThe cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man's sleeve within easy reach of his fingers. A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken. On a pair of ordinary glasses is a square of fine lines near the top of one lens, where it is out of the way of ordinary vision. When an object appears in that square, it is lined up for its picture. As the scientist of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every time he looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter and in it goes, without even an audible click. Is this all fantastic? The only fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many pictures as would result from its use.\nWill there be dry photography? It is already here in two forms. When Brady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time of exposure. Now it has to be wet during development instead. In the future perhaps it need not be wetted at all. There have long been films impregnated with diazo dyes which form a picture without development, so that it is already there as soon as the camera has been operated. An exposure to ammonia gas destroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can then be taken out into the light and examined. The process is now slow, but someone may speed it up, and it has no grain difficulties such as now keep photographic researchers busy. Often it would be advantageous to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.\nAnother process now in use is also slow, and more or less clumsy. For fifty years impregnated papers have been used which turn dark at every point where an electrical contact touches them, by reason of the chemical change thus produced in an iodine compound included in the paper. They have been used to make records, for a pointer moving across them can leave a trail behind. If the electrical potential on the pointer is varied as it moves, the line becomes light or dark in accordance with the potential.\nThis scheme is now used in facsimile transmission. The pointer draws a set of closely spaced lines across the paper one after another. As it moves, its potential is varied in accordance with a varying current received over wires from a distant station, where these variations are produced by a photocell which is similarly scanning a picture. At every instant the darkness of the line being drawn is made equal to the darkness of the point on the picture being observed by the photocell. Thus, when the whole picture has been covered, a replica appears at the receiving end.\nA scene itself can be just as well looked over line by line by the photocell in this way as can a photograph of the scene. This whole apparatus constitutes a camera, with the added feature, which can be dispensed with if desired, of making its picture at a distance. It is slow, and the picture is poor in detail. Still, it does give another process of dry photography, in which the picture is finished as soon as it is taken.\nIt would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail. Television equipment today transmits sixteen reasonably good pictures a second, and it involves only two essential differences from the process described above. For one, the record is made by a moving beam of electrons rather than a moving pointer, for the reason that an electron beam can sweep across the picture very rapidly indeed. The other difference involves merely the use of a screen which glows momentarily when the electrons hit, rather than a chemically treated paper or film which is permanently altered. This speed is necessary in television, for motion pictures rather than stills are the object.\nUse chemically treated film in place of the glowing screen, allow the apparatus to transmit one picture only rather than a succession, and a rapid camera for dry photography results. The treated film needs to be far faster in action than present examples, but it probably could be. More serious is the objection that this scheme would involve putting the film inside a vacuum chamber, for electron beams behave normally only in such a rarefied environment. This difficulty could be avoided by allowing the electron beam to play on one side of a partition, and by pressing the film against the other side, if this partition were such as to allow the electrons to go through perpendicular to its surface, and to prevent them from spreading out sideways. Such partitions, in crude form, could certainly be constructed, and they will hardly hold up the general development.\nLike dry photography, microphotography still has a long way to go. The basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it by projection rather than directly, has possibilities too great to be ignored. The combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. Today, with microfilm, reductions by a linear factor of 20 can be employed and still produce full clarity when the material is re-enlarged for examination. The limits are set by the graininess of the film, the excellence of the optical system, and the efficiency of the light sources employed. All of these are rapidly improving.\nAssume a linear ratio of 100 for future use. Consider film of the same thickness as paper, although thinner film will certainly be usable. Even under these conditions there would be a total factor of 10,000 between the bulk of the ordinary record on books, and its microfilm replica. TheÂ EncyclopÃ¦dia BritannicaÂ could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. If the human race has produced since the invention of movable type a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books, tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be lugged off in a moving van. Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.\nCompression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilmÂ BritannicaÂ would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent. What would it cost to print a million copies? To print a sheet of newspaper, in a large edition, costs a small fraction of a cent. The entire material of theÂ BritannicaÂ in reduced microfilm form would go on a sheet eight and one-half by eleven inches. Once it is available, with the photographic reproduction methods of the future, duplicates in large quantities could probably be turned out for a cent apiece beyond the cost of materials. The preparation of the original copy? That introduces the next aspect of the subject.\n3\nTo make the record, we now push a pencil or tap a typewriter. Then comes the process of digestion and correction, followed by an intricate process of typesetting, printing, and distribution. To consider the first stage of the procedure, will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record? He does so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax cylinder; but the elements are all present if he wishes to have his talk directly produce a typed record. All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language.\nAt a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown. A girl stroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech. No human vocal chords entered into the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined some electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a loud-speaker. In the Bell Laboratories there is the converse of this machine, called a Vocoder. The loudspeaker is replaced by a microphone, which picks up sound. Speak to it, and the corresponding keys move. This may be one element of the postulated system.\nThe other element is found in the stenotype, that somewhat disconcerting device encountered usually at public meetings. A girl strokes its keys languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at the speaker with a disquieting gaze. From it emerges a typed strip which records in a phonetically simplified language a record of what the speaker is supposed to have said. Later this strip is retyped into ordinary language, for in its nascent form it is intelligible only to the initiated. Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder run the stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked to.\nOur present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech. Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible to the layman.\nOne can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments. Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together. If he goes into the field, he may be connected by radio to his recorder. As he ponders over his notes in the evening, he again talks his comments into the record. His typed record, as well as his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that he projects them for examination.\nMuch needs to occur, however, between the collection of data and observations, the extraction of parallel material from the existing record, and the final insertion of new material into the general body of the common record. For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute. But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids.\nAdding a column of figures is a repetitive thought process, and it was long ago properly relegated to the machine. True, the machine is sometimes controlled by a keyboard, and thought of a sort enters in reading the figures and poking the corresponding keys, but even this is avoidable. Machines have been made which will read typed figures by photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are combinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits for sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for interpreting the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys down.\nAll this complication is needed because of the clumsy way in which we have learned to write figures. If we recorded them positionally, simply by the configuration of a set of dots on a card, the automatic reading mechanism would become comparatively simple. In fact if the dots are holes, we have the punched-card machine long ago produced by Hollorith for the purposes of the census, and now used throughout business. Some types of complex businesses could hardly operate without these machines.\nAdding is only one operation. To perform arithmetical computation involves also subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in addition some method for temporary storage of results, removal from storage for further manipulation, and recording of final results by printing. Machines for these purposes are now of two types: keyboard machines for accounting and the like, manually controlled for the insertion of data, and usually automatically controlled as far as the sequence of operations is concerned; and punched-card machines in which separate operations are usually delegated to a series of machines, and the cards then transferred bodily from one to another. Both forms are very useful; but as far as complex computations are concerned, both are still in embryo.\nRapid electrical counting appeared soon after the physicists found it desirable to count cosmic rays. For their own purposes the physicists promptly constructed thermionic-tube equipment capable of counting electrical impulses at the rate of 100,000 a second. The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.\nMoreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial machines, so that they may readily be adapted for a wide variety of operations. They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation. Such machines will have enormous appetites. One of them will take instructions and data from a whole roomful of girls armed with simple key board punches, and will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes. There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things.\n4\nThe repetitive processes of thought are not confined however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine. Not so much has been done along these lines, beyond the bounds of arithmetic, as might be done, primarily because of the economics of the situation. The needs of business and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as production methods were sufficiently advanced.\nWith machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for there was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of manipulating data are a very small part of the population. There are, however, machines for solving differential equationsâand functional and integral equations, for that matter. There are many special machines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides. There will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the scientist and in small numbers.\nIf scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability. The abacus, with its beads strung on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration and the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world; and it was a useful toolâso useful that it still exists.\nIt is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the future. But even this new machine will not take the scientist where he needs to go. Relief must be secured from laborious detailed manipulation of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules. A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is not even a man who can readily perform the transformations of equations by the use of calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs.\nAll else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as confidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the intricate mechanism under the hood. Only then will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology. For this reason there still come more machines to handle advanced mathematics for the scientist. Some of them will be sufficiently bizarre to suit the most fastidious connoisseur of the present artifacts of civilization.\n5\nThe scientist, however, is not the only person who manipulates data and examines the world about him by the use of logical processes, although he sometimes preserves this appearance by adopting into the fold anyone who becomes logical, much in the manner in which a British labor leader is elevated to knighthood. Whenever logical processes of thought are employedâthat is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted grooveâthere is an opportunity for the machine. Formal logic used to be a keen instrument in the hands of the teacher in his trying of students' souls. It is readily possible to construct a machine which will manipulate premises in accordance with formal logic, simply by the clever use of relay circuits. Put a set of premises into such a device and turn the crank, and it will readily pass out conclusion after conclusion, all in accordance with logical law, and with no more slips than would be expected of a keyboard adding machine.\nLogic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis have usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for equation transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed by an equation in accordance with strict and rather advanced logic. Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field.\nA new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the reduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes. Then, on beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register. But the machine of logic will not look like a cash register, even of the streamlined model.\nSo much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than beforeâfor we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.\nSelection, in this broad sense, is a stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker. Yet, in a narrow sense and in other areas, something has already been done mechanically on selection. The personnel officer of a factory drops a stack of a few thousand employee cards into a selecting machine, sets a code in accordance with an established convention, and produces in a short time a list of all employees who live in Trenton and know Spanish. Even such devices are much too slow when it comes, for example, to matching a set of fingerprints with one of five million on file. Selection devices of this sort will soon be speeded up from their present rate of reviewing data at a few hundred a minute. By the use of photocells and microfilm they will survey items at the rate of a thousand a second, and will print out duplicates of those selected.\nThis process, however, is simple selection: it proceeds by examining in turn every one of a large set of items, and by picking out those which have certain specified characteristics. There is another form of selection best illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange. You dial a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a million possible stations. It does not run over them all. It pays attention only to a class given by a first digit, then only to a subclass of this given by the second digit, and so on; and thus proceeds rapidly and almost unerringly to the selected station. It requires a few seconds to make the selection, although the process could be speeded up if increased speed were economically warranted. If necessary, it could be made extremely fast by substituting thermionic-tube switching for mechanical switching, so that the full selection could be made in one one-hundredth of a second. No one would wish to spend the money necessary to make this change in the telephone system, but the general idea is applicable elsewhere.\nTake the prosaic problem of the great department store. Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and, most important, the customer needs to be charged. A central records device has been developed in which much of this work is done conveniently. The salesman places on a stand the customer's identification card, his own card, and the card taken from the article soldâall punched cards. When he pulls a lever, contacts are made through the holes, machinery at a central point makes the necessary computations and entries, and the proper receipt is printed for the salesman to pass to the customer.\nBut there may be ten thousand charge customers doing business with the store, and before the full operation can be completed someone has to select the right card and insert it at the central office. Now rapid selection can slide just the proper card into position in an instant or two, and return it afterward. Another difficulty occurs, however. Someone must read a total on the card, so that the machine can add its computed item to it. Conceivably the cards might be of the dry photography type I have described. Existing totals could then be read by photocell, and the new total entered by an electron beam.\nThe cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space. They must move quickly. They need not be transferred far, but merely into position so that the photocell and recorder can operate on them. Positional dots can enter the data. At the end of the month a machine can readily be made to read these and to print an ordinary bill. With tube selection, in which no mechanical parts are involved in the switches, little time need be occupied in bringing the correct card into useâa second should suffice for the entire operation. The whole record on the card may be made by magnetic dots on a steel sheet if desired, instead of dots to be observed optically, following the scheme by which Poulsen long ago put speech on a magnetic wire. This method has the advantage of simplicity and ease of erasure. By using photography, however one can arrange to project the record in enlarged form and at a distance by using the process common in television equipment.\nOne can consider rapid selection of this form, and distant projection for other purposes. To be able to key one sheet of a million before an operator in a second or two, with the possibility of then adding notes thereto, is suggestive in many ways. It might even be of use in libraries, but that is another story. At any rate, there are now some interesting combinations possible. One might, for example, speak to a microphone, in the manner described in connection with the speech controlled typewriter, and thus make his selections. It would certainly beat the usual file clerk.\n6\nThe real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path.\nThe human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.\nMan cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.\nConsider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, \"memex\" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.\nIt consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.\nIn one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.\nMost of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.\nThere is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use. Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.\nA special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.\n7\nAll this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.\nWhen the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.\nThereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.\nThe owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.\nAnd his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.\n8\nWholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.\nThe historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the [[task]] of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The [[inheritance]] from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.\nThus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the instrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick closely to methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.\nAll our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the sensesâthe tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that some day the path may be established more directly?\nWe know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the electrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.\nThe impulses which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?\nBy bone conduction we already introduce sounds: into the nerve channels of the deaf in order that they may hear. Is it not possible that we may learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?\nIn the outside world, all forms of intelligence whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of process occurs. Must we always transform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.\nPresumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.\nThe applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.\nRecently I was asked\nIf I have a [[Tree]] how does it know if I'm talking about (the plant) vs (the datastructure)?

`\n15:58\nThe most important [[Features]] that [[Roam]] has which other team knowledge bases don't are\n[[Bidirectional Links]]\nsee [[Mentions]]\n[[Precise Links]]\nsee ((2428)) or ((1820))\n[[Embedding Content Across Pages]]\nAll of those are really important if you don't want to end up with your notes stuck in disconnected [[Silos]] \nOr if you want to make sure -- when you're considering a topic/project, you can see all your teammates notes on the subject -- regardless of where they wrote things down.\nExample of how your workflow is different if you use Roam vs other tool\nIn any other tool -- like [[Notion]] -- you might have a lot of different kinds of notes\nfor example\nYou might have meeting notes, organized by day\nYou have notes about projects you're working\nYou have notes about the other people or organizations you're working with\nWho works where or with whom\nYou might have open questions you're trying to solve at work\nA paper you're trying to write\nA product you're designing or building\nYou might have notes from books or articles you're reading\nIn a tool like Notion, those things are separated by default\nIf you want to connect things together -- you have to create a whole bunch of databases for each type of note, and figure out one set of relationships for how all those things connect\nThis means you that if you want to avoid silos -- you have to know ahead of time how you want your different databases to be connected, and follow a pretty rigid structure for writing things down\nRoam solves this nicely with [[Precise Links]] and [[Bidirectional Links]]\nWith Roam if you have notes of all those types from ((2914))\nWhen you have a meeting with a person, all you need to remember is to create a link for that person's name.\nWe suggest just making a bullet point like ((2875)) and writing the notes for that meeting under that heading\nNow you'll have a page for every person in the meeting\nYou can easily see all the notes you've ever taken from meetings with them -- or meetings where their name came up -- or any other content about them.\nIf during the meeting they mention a concept you can just create a link or tag for that concept  \nIf the meeting has an action item -- you can add a [[task]] right there\nyou can take your notes for that meeting in the daily notes page -- or on the page for the project you're working on -- or under that person's page -- it doesn't matter. \nBecause of [[Bidirectional Links]] -- just by referencing a page, you're collecting all the notes you write on that page\nSo now you can filter all your meeting notes with a particular person to only find the things they said that were relevant to Concept X or Project Y\naka [[Mentions]]\nPrecise links go to a particular block \nusually they are called [[Block References]], because you are embedding the content of the block somewhere else\nYou generate them by either\nRight-clicking a bullet point, and then selecting

mind.**\n\nit helps me organize thoughts and **reduce the clutter in my head**. This is something that no productivity or organization tool, including Google Drive and Microsoft Office, **has ever offered to me before.**\nfrom\nRoam [is] a brilliant new organizational and productivity tool in the form of a web app that is compatible with how the mind actually operates: networked thought. In your Roam account, you essentially build a personal wiki from the ground up with your own pages. You can create bi-directional links to any page and embed content from one page to another, so you no longer need to choose which singular location to put information-- if you put something on one page, **you can have it appear on any other page you'd like without manually editing each location.** Among other great features, it's like Google Docs in that **it automatically saves your work and allows for simultaneous collaboration**, it supports Latex, and it has a sidebar where you can open up/edit other pages so you don't lose your spot. The understated feature that I am most excited about actually is the graph view (see below), which is functionally just an overview of your pages, but to me encompasses the essence of Roam. **I see it as a productivity map of my brain, showing to me how I organize thoughts in my mind.** The reason why I consider this so powerful is because **I get instant feedback on the organization of my mind and as such it helps me organize thoughts and reduce the clutter in my head. This is something that no productivity or organization tool, including Google Drive and Microsoft Office, has ever offered to me before.**\n\nFor me, **Roam is the productivity tool that I didn't know I needed**. It took about a day of getting used to before I instantly adopted it into my daily regimen. **I used to use a combination of written daily planners, Evernote, Wunderlist, Google drive, and Microsoft Office to record my thoughts, [[task]]s, notes, and research. Now I use Roam.** Although it's in its early stages and currently developed by only a two person team, it clearly has tremendous potential. I encourage anyone who's never been quite satisfied with their organization tools, especially technically-oriented, scatterbrained researchers like myself, to give Roam a try with an open mind.\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FrjUwntetcO?alt=media&token=c3b4c56e-5294-42c0-bad3-b81971953bfa)\n[[Mansi Jain]][[Stanford]]\nRoam has enabled me to stop segmenting and limiting my thoughts before Iâve even fleshed them out.

The short answer is \"Workflowy meets Google Docs.\" But really it's a replacement for the essay.\n\nYou can make infinitely nested concepts, in a similar bullet-point format to WorkFlowy.\n\nBut you can also reference all mentions to a concept. And use inline LaTeX. And a couple other things that make it possible to use this for argument mapping.\n\nSo when you take notes on something you're reading, you're actually building the logical structure of the text's argument into the notation.\n\nBecause it's mostly keyboard shortcuts, not drag-and-drop, it has the potential to be as fast as writing text in a word processor. But *much more structured.*\n\nAt a minimum it allows me to synthesize all my self-tracking techniques (which currently live in WorkFlowy and Google Sheets) into one tool.\n\nBut it has the potential to be *way* more.

If it's clunky to take notes, you won't. So, Roam has keyboard shortcuts for links and indents and other applications (like LaTeX markup!) It also has very rapid loading times, so it's less irritating to use than a word processor or Google Docs. You can add and link pages as fast as you can type. \nMainly, I use my memex as a personal record of my thoughts. I make pages for concepts of interest, including references to people. (\"Memex\" has its own page.)Â  On each day's \"daily notes\", I add links to things I read, my reactions to conversations or things I've read, worries on my mind, drafts of arguments (diagrammed out with heavy use of indents; supporting arguments are threaded beneath the claims they justify) etc. When I mention a concept, I tag the word so it links to the corresponding concept page.\nI've noticed this allows me to think in a more nuanced way. When I don't have to compress an idea to make it easier to communicate with others, I can allow it to have dependencies, exceptions, conditionals...all the sub-clauses that make it hard to fit in a tweet.\nIt also allows me to gain more temporal consistency -- more sense of the commonalities between me-of-last-week and me-of-this-week, to remember when I keep coming back to the same thoughts, etc.\nAnd it has the usual advantages of diaries -- helps me process my emotions, helps me make sense of my thoughts, helps me keep track of my life.\n\n![https://twitter.com/s_r_constantin/status/1160730159495782400](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FevQmJ9Icdw.png?alt=media&token=159f4dba-9896-4aa9-beb7-88d60bf7d4e9)\n[[Chelsea Voss]]\nThe thing that's delighted me most about Roam has been how having it open in a tab affects my entire attitude about research\n\nI feel like I'm playing  __learning: the video game__ something I've wanted for a long time. \nextracted from::\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FScreenshot%202019-08-19%2018.00.33.png?alt=media&token=2de750b6-4ad2-4871-b4ce-d08f716e3426)\n\n\nThe thing that's delighted me most about Roam has been how having it open in a tab affects my entire attitude about research.

Software engineering has gone from waterfall projects that release updates as standalone monoliths from a closed-source warehouse, to agile-developed remotely-updated differential improvements that may be supported a large community. Academic literature by contrast is still structured as it was in the early days of physical publishing, and has barely adapted (and this is putting it extremely kindly) for [[task]]s such as retractions or sharing data. Citations often do not distinguish between which works are being used as supporting material, which are discredited, which are being supported, or which are being used as examples (positive or negative). The idea of making techniques like revision control, bug-flagging, and dependency management available for scientific research (much like what software engineering uses) is a change Iâm definitely in favor of. Some projects are already underway in restructuring scientific knowledge into these kinds of collaborative tools, such asÂ [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)Â or theÂ [Polymath Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project). Having a scientific literature version ofÂ [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph)Â would be a far superior alternative to the increasingly bureaucratic review and publishing process.\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FedyVXYvLzb?alt=media&token=23f8e6c1-8c5a-43e6-a216-94d6cf32183a)\nAka

Matuschak]]'s [[Essay]] [[How can we develop transformative tools for thought?]]\nsource:: https://numinous.productions/ttft/ \nfirst impressions::\nI'm a bit disappointed that the whole first part of the essay is dealing with memory and education.\nThere is definitely something significant about building a better textbook -- which is what [[Quantum Country]] is\nit is totally correct to have a piece which is giving you long form material have a problem set, and spaced-repetition style tutorial built into it.\nTo me this feels like taking what works about school (you read something and are then tested on it), and then optimize that by presenting the tests immediately upon reading, and then following an optimum forgetting curve.\nYes -- if we had more material online like this, we would definitely have better knowledge transfer from teachers to their students\nYes -- many complex thoughts do require that you have the fundamental concepts down in order to do any sort of interesting novel work with them\nBut somehow this feels like learning, which is differant than thinking\nOk, so parts of this essay are sort of infuriating to me right now\nParticularly ((bY263ol8J)) in relation to ((K-k4h9oOA))\nThis just seems insane thing to ignore if your claim is that immersing yourself in the field is insufficient to generate the relevant insights -- since immersing yourself in the field -- as I see it, would ensure you eventually found someone who knew something about Babylon\nI'm also taking for granted that \nthe situation where Roman culture had displaced good Bablyonian ideas isn't unique.  \nWe've now displaced good ideas from the 60s 70s and 80s\nreason::\n((RSVzzBVGe))\nI mean -- maybe someone like IDEO who is doing a 1 year project is going to fail this way -- but what the hell is the person doing by ((XgYu0Fu11)) ((wv8YJXt_i)) if not trying to reach a deep enough understanding of the field to have the relevant insights for solving their design problem\nI'm going to hope that there is some stuff later that presents an alternative to \nPerhaps what they're saying is that iff you only focused on ((JQtXIisdJ)) you wouldn't have a wide enough definition of the field, you wouldn't be able to find anyone who knew anything about how they did things in Bablyon, or if you did you wouldn't be interested in the approaches that they were taking\nThis seems like a more reasonable critique of the current design community -- specifically related to [[Bret Victor]]'s talk where he slams software for not paying attention to the good ideas from the ancestors \n\nsee [[The Future of Programming]] {{youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4}}\nI might have been a little to hard on this ((rFrIX3_sH))\nParticularly thinking about it in Relation to [[Roam]]\nYes, for the past few years we've been doing something a bit more like ((yCZFWt57R)) -- due to a funding model where we could only get paid to build things that users in the AI Research community were asking for -- and yes, that was extremely frustrating because we definitely were trying to explore fundamental ideas that hadn't been manifested in any previous tool\nHowever -- doing this did put a lot of pressure on us to feature match the existing tools -- which were necessary to get adoption, and to even begin to introduce users to the new concepts in Roam\nThe better insights came from things like learning about [[Zettelkasten]], or [[Tiago Forte]]'s explanations related ideas with [[Intermediate Packets]]\nThere was also a sort of aesthetic itch to be able to build these sort of knowledge graphs, so that we could go off in tangents, but then be able to concisely organize a set of complex interrelated claims and questions\nKey Questions::\nWhat are the [[Deep Insights]] in [[Roam]]?\nIt does feel tough to say, because it does feel like many of the deepest insight's we've had we haven't been able to implement yet -- partially because some of the problems are still unsolved \n((L4lL2O_Og))\nAlso, many of the deep insights currently are barely expressed in the UI -- they'll only really come out in future features we have in development\nspecifically thinking about the way we want to combine [[Associative Data Model]] with [[Graph Databases]] and [[Event Logs]]\nOr the models of version control and sharing that are inspired by [[Federated Wiki]]\nWhere did the [[Deep Insights]] in [[Roam]] come from?\n[[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s [[Analogy as the Core of Cognition]] and the larger book [[Surfaces and Essences]]\nOpen Question::\nDo things like [[Word Vectors]] from ML capture any of the things that are expressed in analogy?\nHow would you stress test or expand an analogy with a tool like [[Roam]]?\nWell, you could be a hell of a lot more specific than is available in just text\nThe example given in [[Surfaces and Essences]]\n((SpSySlBTE)) is ((xI0L6YVDM)) of ((wL3Znq-Zw))\nBob Marley\nThe Pope\nReggae\nOne of the key things we figured out I think, was to not try to write a programming language that would actually say much about the Meaning of that statement ((R1EOgine4))\nTo really dive into that -- if you wanted to try and evaluate whether it was true -- you'd have to figure out some things about the relationship between the pope and the catholic church -- or perhaps the pope to others outside the catholic church (or maybe you actually mean to God) -- and then you'd say something like does ((SpSySlBTE)) have the same sort of relationship to ((wL3Znq-Zw)) as the pope does to any of the things you might be comparing him to\nIn the english sentence, there is a shit-ton of ambiguity about what the speaker actually means by that statement\nEven when they write it, even if they then tried to explain it, they  definitely aren't going to be able to capture all the possible interpretations of what that statement could mean. \nSo, the thing we adopted instead was something like [[Block Mentions]] which just allow you to target particular \"nodes\" which are just lines of text in the knowledge graph\n[[The Universal Design Pattern]] by [[Steve Yegge]] which draws on Doug's work from [[Godel Escher Bach]]\n[[Clojure]] -- specificially [[Rich Hickey]]'s talk on [[Design Composition and Performance]]\nThe further I get into the essay though, the more I'm troubled by their use of the term [[Tools for Thought]] to describe the [[Mnemonic Content]] they're talking about building!\nThe whole thing is about Pedagogy!\nit's all about transferring existing stores of knowlege!\nNot about the creativity of Remixing Ideas in order to generate new ones\nNot about the process of actually relating the new idea to other things you've learned\nNot about the process of solving problems\nYes - For damn sure, we need better educational content -- but the idea that a better tool for ensuring lossless transfer of a set of ideas from one person to another through media - interactive or otherwise -- is so fucking different from what I think anyone like [[Doug Engelbart]] or [[Howard Rheingold]] meant when they talked about [[Tools for Thought]]\n[[Book: Tools for Thought]]\nThe stuff that [[Ivan Sutherland]] was doing with [[Sketchpad]] wasn't about educational content, it was about direct manipulation in order to solve harder problems\nThese guys should know better than to do this\nHaven't they read\n[[Augmenting the Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]]\nThe last few sections of the document seem to be the most interesting -- but they're buried with too much demo of a tool that is more about education than about problem solving and original thinking\nTransmission is a part of the problem -- learning the things you need to know is a crucial part of [[getting into a position to think]]\n((9F_g4O1DD))\n((7KsnSCr5a))\nTweet Storm::\nExtremely frustrated with the latest  essay from [[Michael Nielsen]] and [[Andy Matuschak]] on Tools for Thought

However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmission or private communications made between User and Roam or between Users of Roam, and other Users may abuse or misuse Usersâ personal information that they collect from the sites. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, User agrees to hold harmless Roam in the event that a third party unlawfully intercepts or accesses any information provided by User to Roam.\n4.2. Account Access. Userâs password is the key to Userâs account. User should use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and should not disclose its Roam account password to anyone. If User does share its password or its personal information with others, User acknowledges and understands that User is responsible for all action taken in the name of Userâs account. If User loses control of its password, User may lose substantial control over its personal and financial information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on Userâs behalf. If Userâs password has been compromised for any reason, User should immediately contact and notify Roam and User should change its password.\n5. Data Modification and Retention\n5.1. User can see, review and change most of its personal and financial information by signing into Userâs Roam account. Generally, Roam will not manually modify Userâs personal or financial information because it is difficult to verify your identity remotely. Accordingly, we strongly encourage, and sometimes require, Users to update their personal and financial information directly in their Roam account if it changes or is inaccurate.\n5.2. Upon Userâs written request, Roam will close Userâs account and remove Userâs personal and financial information from view as soon as reasonably practicable, based on Userâs account activity and in accordance with applicable law. However, User acknowledges, understands and consents that Roam may retain Userâs personal and financial information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce the Roam Terms and Conditions, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.\n5.3. We store the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.\n6. Disclosure\n6.1. Roam may disclose personal or financial information to respond to legal requirements, to enforce our policies, or to protect anyoneâs rights or property. Accordingly, Userâs information may be shared with:\n6.1.1. Members of the Roam corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts;\n6.1.2. Service providers under contract who provide assistance for our business operations (such as fraud investigations and bill collection);\n6.1.3. Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, Roam may disclose information relevant to the investigation, including name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, user ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and bid and offer (order) history;\n6.1.4. Other business entities, should Roam plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. Should a merger or acquisition occur, Roam will require that the new entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to Userâs personal and financial information. If Userâs personal or financial information will be used in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, User will receive notice.\n6.2 We may also share your personal information with other third parties, including other users, in the following circumstances:\n6.2.1. Databases Accessible by Other Users: When you submit personal information in a database that can be accessed by others, such personal information may be displayed to other users in the same or connected databases. For example, your personal information may be included in your notes or reminders in a database which can be viewed by other users collaborating with you in that database. Further, your email address or photo may be displayed with your database profile to other users collaborating with you in that database. This may apply to both Public Databases and Private Databases from within which you have shared a specific page.\n6.2.2. Share Content with Friends or Colleagues: Our Services may allow you to provide information about your friends, and may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an invitation email.\n6.3.Without limiting the authorizations under **Section 4.1** hereof, and in an effort to respect Userâs privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Roam will not otherwise disclose Userâs personal or financial information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.\n7. Childrenâs Information\nThe Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us as set forth below. If we learn that we have collected a childâs personal information without parental consent in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the childâs account.\n8.

What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?**Â This is a very complicated and somewhat subtle set of questions. Let's give a simple example to illustrate the idea. We've presented the cards in the mnemonic medium as though they are standalone entities. But there are connections between the cards. Suppose you have cards: âWho was George Washingtonâs Vice President?â (Answer: âJohn Adamsâ, with a picture of Adams); âWhat did John Adams look like?â (Answer: a picture of Adams); perhaps a question involving a sketch of Adams and Washington together at some key moment; and so on. Now, this set of cards forms a network of interrelated cards. And you can use a memory system likeÂ Quantum CountryÂ to study that network. What happens to people's observed recall if you remove a card? Are there crucial lynchpin cards? Are there particularly effective network structures? Particularly effective types of relationship between cards? Crucially: are there general principles we can identify about finding the deepest, most powerful ways of representing knowledge in this system?\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FymZwYdw6F1?alt=media&token=8bf5f034-90c5-4e5a-87eb-277971c87968)\nFrom ((l3osU5fMB))\nAlso remarkable, consider that when we add the numbers 72 and 83 we at some point will likely use 2+3=5; similarly, when we add 27 and 38 we will also use 2+3=5, despite the fact that the meaning of 2 and 3 in the second sum is completely different than in the first sum. In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases.Â We take this for granted, but this similarity in behavior is a consequence of deep facts about the number system: commutativity, associativity, and distributivity \n\nAll these properties (and many more) point to the design and mathematical insights being inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa.\n---\nThis is rather sobering if we compare to conventional modern design practice. \nIn a typical practice, \nyou'd interview domain experts (in this case, mathematicians), \nand read any relevant literature. \nYou'd talk to users of existing systems, \nand analyze serious behavior, \nboth individually and at scale. \nIn short, you'd do what people in the design community refer to as immersing themselves in the target field.\nThis is a powerful practice. At its best it causes systems to come into existence which would otherwise be inconceivable. If applied to Roman numerals (in hypothetical ancient Rome, not today) {{alias: ((bY263ol8J)) 24}} this practice would likely improve them a great deal. But it would not provide anywhere near the level of mathematical insight needed to arrive at Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n--------\n$$\\color{red}24.$$ Of course, a designer who spoke to an expert on, say, Babylonian mathematics, might well have come across some of these ideas. We'll ignore that, since it depends on the oddity that many excellent prior ideas about numeral systems had been displaced in Roman culture.)\nFrom this discussion, we take away a warning and an aspiration.\nThe warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought. Indeed, that's part of the reason there's been so little progress from the tech industry on tools for thought. This sounds like a knock on conventional product practice, but it's not. That practice has been astoundingly successful at its purpose: creating great businesses. But it's also what Alan Kay has dubbed a pop culture, not a research culture. To build transformative tools for thought we need to go beyond that pop culture.\nThe aspiration is for any team serious about making transformative tools for thought. It's to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of the (very different) modern research culture.Â ![Diagram:\n\t'insight' and 'making', pointing to each other in a loop](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/insight_through_making.svg)You need the insight-through-making loop to operate, whereby deep, original insights about the subject feed back to change and improve the system, and changes to the system result in deep, original insights about the subject.\nNote that we are not making the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. This is correct, but is much weaker than what we are saying. Rather: making new tools can lead to new subject matter insightsÂ for humanity as a wholeÂ (i.e., significant original research insights), and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.\nDoing this is a cultural struggle. It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the insight-through-making loop working at full throttle. People with expertise on one side of the loop often have trouble perceiving (much less understanding and participating in) the nature of the work that goes on on the other side of the loop. You have researchers, brilliant in their domain, who think of making as something essentially trivial, âjust a matter of implementationâ. And you have makers who don't understand research at all, who see it as merely a rather slow and dysfunctional (and unprofitable) making process. This is certainly true in Silicon Valley, where it's common to meet accomplished technical makers who, after reading a few stories from Richard Hamming and Richard Feynman, think they understand research well enough that they can âcreate the new Bell Labsâ. Usually they're victims of Dunning-Krugeritis, so ignorant they're not even aware of their ignorance.\nOf course, we've got a long way to go withÂ Quantum Country. It's not yet generating nearly deep enough ideas about memory and cognition; it's not yet one of the world's foremost memory laboratories. And considered as a product, it's also in the very earliest days; we're not yet iterating nearly fast enough, nor learning nearly fast enough from the system. Getting the insight-through-making loop to operate at full throttle will mean reinventing parts of both research culture and conventional product development culture; it will mean new norms and a new type of person involved in key decision making. But that's the aspiration, and what we believe is necessary to develop transformative tools for thought.\nFrom Why there isn'tmore work on tools for thought today\nUnfortunately for Adobe, such mediums are extremely expensive to develop, and it's difficult to prevent other companies from cheaply copying the ideas or developing near-equivalents. Consider, for example, the way the programÂ SketchÂ has eaten into Adobe's market share, after duplicating many of the best features from several of Adobe's products, perhaps most notablyÂ Illustrator. And consider the wayÂ FigmaÂ is now eating into bothÂ SketchÂ andÂ Illustrator's market share. BothÂ SketchÂ andÂ FigmaÂ have done this without needing to make an enormous investment in research. That's a big advantage they have over Adobe.\nAs Marc Andreessen has observed (In Elad Gil's âHigh Growth Handbookâ (2018)  true defensibility purely at the product level is really rare in [Silicon] Valley, because there are a lot of really good engineersâ¦ And then there's the issue of leap-frogging. The next team has the opportunity to learn from what you did and then build something better.\nPut another way, many tools for thought are public goods. They often cost a lot to develop initially, but it's easy for others to duplicate and improve on them, free riding on the initial investment. While such duplication and improvement is good for our society as a whole, it's bad for the companies that make that initial investment. And so such tools for thought suffer the fate of many public goods: our society collectively underinvests in them, relative to the benefits they provide.\nUnfortunately, the novelty-based short-term revenue approach of the game industry doesn't work. You want people to really master the best new tools for thought, developing virtuoso skill, not spend a few dozen hours (as with most games) getting pretty good, and then moving onto something new.\nThe two most promising approaches seem to us to be:\nPhilanthropic funding for research. This approach was used, for instance, by the field of computer animation and animated movies. Decades of public research work on computer animation resulted in a large number of powerful and (in many cases) publicly available ideas. This, in turn, helped prepare the way for companies such as Pixar and Dreamworks, which developed many of the ideas further, and took them to scale.\nThe model used by Adobe and similar companies, in which new tools for thought are a central part of the company's operations, but not the core of their competitive moat. That moat may instead be built around training, marketing, documentation, and so on.\nFrom Questioning our basic premises\nâWhat will new tools for thought be like?â is a question we hear often. And yet, almost by definition, we cannot say. As we noted earlier, if we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person's thinking, or even their consciousness. Concretely: to understand the mnemonic medium you must use it intensively over an extended period. And even then you may not be conscious of the effect; we've done interviews with users who are apparently unaware of the incredible level of recall they have of material in the essay they have read. \nOne of the most famous papers in the philosophy of consciousness is entitled âWhat is it like to be a bat?â Each tool for thought poses a similar question, near impossible to answer without immersion in the tool: âWhat is it like to be a language user? A musician?â and so on.\nIt seems plausible to us that work on tools for thought will be, over the next few decades, more important than work on AGI and BCI. And, given how fashionable and well-funded work on AGI and BCI currently is, it seems nearly certain that work on tools for thought offers vastly greater benefit, at the margin.\nsource:: \nhttp://worrydream.com/refs/Hofstadter%20-%20Analogy%20as%20the%20Core%20of%20Cognition.pdf\nQuotes::\nOnce upon a time, I was invited to speak at an analogy workshop in the legendary city of Sofia in the far-off land of Bulgaria. Having accepted but wavering as to what to say, I finally chose to eschew technicalities and instead to convey a personal perspective on the importance and centrality of analogy-making in cognition. One way I could suggest this perspective is to rechant a refrain that Iâve chanted quite oft in the past, to wit:\nOne should not think of analogy-making as a special variety ofÂ reasoningÂ (as in the dull and uninspiring phrase âanalogical reasoning and problem-solving,â a long-standing clichÃ© in the cognitive-science world), for that is to do analogy a terrible disservice. After all, reasoning and problem-solving have (at least I dearly hope!) been at long last recognized as lying far indeed from the core of human thought. If analogy were merely a special variety of something that in itself lies way out on the peripheries, then it would be but an itty-bitty blip in the broad blue sky of cognition. To me, however, analogy is anything but a bitty blip â rather, itâs the very blue that fills the whole sky of cognition â analogy isÂ everything,Â or very nearly so, in my view.\nEnd of oft-chanted refrain. If you donât like it, you wonât like what follows.\nThe thrust of my chapter is to persuade readers of this unorthodox viewpoint, or failing that, at least to give them a strong whiff of it. In that sense, then, my article shares with Richard Dawkinsâs eye-opening bookÂ The Selfish GeneÂ (Dawkins 1976) the quality of trying to make a scientific contribution mostly by suggesting to readers a shift of viewpoint â a new take on familiar phenomena. For Dawkins, the shift was to turn causality on its head, so that the old quip âa chicken is an eggâs way of making another eggâ might be taken not as a joke but quite seriously. In my case, the shift is to suggest that every concept we have is essentially nothing but a tightly packaged bundle of analogies, and to suggest that all we do when we think is to move fluidly from concept to concept â in other words, to leap from one analogy-bundle to another â and to suggest, lastly, that such concept-to-concept leaps are themselves made via analogical connection, to boot.\nThis viewpoint may be overly ambitious, and may even â horrors! -- be somewhat wrong, but I have observed that many good ideas start out by claiming too much territory for themselves, and eventually, when they have received their fair share of attention and respect, the air clears and it emerges that, though still grand, they are not quite so grand and all-encompassing as their proponents first thought. But thatâs all right. As for me, I just hope that my view finds a few sympathetic readers. That would be a fine start.\nTwo Riddles\nWe begin with a couple of simple queries about familiar phenomena: âWhy do babies not remember events that happen to them?â and âWhy does each new year seem to pass faster than the one before?â\nI wouldnât swear that I have the final answer to either one of these queries, but I do have a hunch, and I will here speculate on the basis of that hunch. And thus: the answer to both is basically the same, I would argue, and it has to do with the relentless, lifelong process of chunking â taking âsmallâ concepts and putting them together into bigger and bigger ones, thus recursively building up a giant repertoire of concepts in the mind.\nHow, then, might chunking provide the clue to these riddles? Well, babiesâ concepts are simply too small. They have no way of framing entire events whatsoever in terms of their novice concepts. It is as if babies were looking at life through a randomly drifting keyhole, and at each moment could make out only the most local aspects of scenes before them. It would be hopeless to try to figure out how a wholeÂ roomÂ is organized, for instance, given just a keyhole view, even a randomly drifting keyhole view.\nOr, to trot out another analogy, life is like a chess game, and babies are like beginners looking at a complex scene on a board, not having the faintest idea how to organize it into higher-level structures. As has been well known for decades, experienced chess players chunk the setup of pieces on the board nearly instantaneously into small dynamic groupings defined by their strategic meanings, and thanks to this automatic, intuitive chunking, they can make good moves nearly instantaneously and also can remember complex chess situations for very long times. Much the same holds for bridge players, who effortlessly remember every bid and every play in a game, and months later can still recite entire games at the drop of a hat.\nAll of this is due to chunking, and I speculate that babies are to life as novice players are to the games they are learning â they simply lack the experience that allows understanding (or even perceiving) of large structures, and so nothing above a rather low level of abstraction gets perceived at all, let alone remembered in later years. As one grows older, however, oneâs chunks grow in size and in number, and consequently one automatically starts to perceive and to frame ever larger events and constellations of events; by the time one is nearing oneâs teen years, complex fragments from lifeâs stream are routinely stored as high-level wholes â and chunks just keep on accreting and becoming more numerous as one lives. Events that a baby or young child could not have possibly perceived as such â events that stretch out over many minutes, hours, days, or even weeks â are effortlessly perceived and stored away as single structures with much internal detail (varying amounts of which can be pulled up and contemplated in retrospect, depending on context). Babies do not have large chunks and simply cannot put things together coherently. Claims by some people that they remember complex events from when they were but a few months old (some even claim to remember being born!) strike me as nothing more than highly deluded wishful thinking.\nSo much for question number one. As for number two, the answer, or so I would claim, is very similar. The more we live, the larger our repertoire of [[concepts]] becomes, which allows us to gobble up ever larger coherent stretches of life in single mental chunks. As we start seeing lifeâs patterns on higher and higher levels, the lower levels nearly vanish from our perception. This effectively means that seconds, once so salient to our baby selves, nearly vanish from sight, and then minutes go the way of seconds, and soon so do hours, and then days, and then weeks...\nâBoy, this year sure went by fast!â is so tempting to say because each year is perceived in terms of chunks at a higher, grander, larger level than any year preceding it, and therefore each passing year contains fewer top-level chunks than any year preceding it, and so, psychologically, each year seems sparser than any of its predecessors. One might, somewhat facetiously, symbolize the ever-rapider passage of time by citing the famous harmonic series:\n1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 +...\nby which I mean to suggest that oneâsÂ nth year feels subjectivelyÂ nÂ times as short as oneâs first year, orÂ n/5Â times as short as oneâs fifth year, and so on. Thus when one is an adult, the years seem to go by about at roughly a constant rate, because â for instance â (1/35)/(1/36) is very nearly 1. Nonetheless, according to this theory, year 70 would still shoot by twice as fast as year 35 did, and seven times as fast as year 10 did.\nBut the exact numerical values shown above are not what matter; I just put them in for entertainment value. The more central and more serious idea is simply that relentless mental chunking makes life seem to pass ever faster as one ages, and there is nothing one can do about it. So much for our two riddles.\nAnalogy, Abstract Categories, and High-level Perception\nBefore I go any further, I would like to relate all this to analogy, for to some the connection may seem tenuous, if not nonexistent. And yet to me, by contrast, analogy does not just lurk darkly here, but is right up there, front and center. I begin with the mundane observation that vision takes an input of millions of retinal dots and gives an output of concepts â often words or phrases, such as âduck,â âVictorian house,â âfunky chair,â âJoyce Carol Oates hairdo,â or âlooks sort of like President Eisenhower.â The (visual) perceptual process, in other words, can be thought of as the triggering of mental categories â often standard lexical items â by scenes. Of course, high-level perception can take place through other sensory modalities: we can hear a low rumbling noise and say âhelicopter,â can sniff something and remark âdoctorâs office,â can taste something and find the words âokra curryâ jumping to our tongue, and so on.\nIn fact, I should stress that the upper echelons of high-level perception totally transcend the normal flavor of the word âperception,â for at the highest levels, input modality plays essentially no role. Let me explain. Suppose I read a newspaper article about the violent expulsion of one group of people by another group from some geographical region, and the phrase âethnic cleansing,â nowhere present in the article, pops into my head. What has happened here is a quintessential example of high-level perception â but what was the input medium? Someone might say it was vision, since I used my eyes to read the newspaper. But really, was I perceiving ethnic cleansing visually? Hardly. Indeed, I might have heard the newspaper article read aloud to me and had the same exact thought pop to mind. Would that mean that I had aurally perceived ethnic cleansing? Or else I might be blind and have read the article in Braille â in other words, with my fingertips, not my eyes or ears. Would that mean that I had tactilely perceived ethnic cleansing? The suggestion is absurd.\nThe sensory input modality of a complex story is totally irrelevant; all that matters is how it jointly activates a host of interrelated concepts, in such a way that further concepts (e.g., âethnic cleansingâ) are automatically accessed and brought up to center stage. Thus âhigh-level perceptionâ is a kind of misnomer when it reaches the most abstract levels, but I donât know what else to call it, because I see no sharp line separating it from cases of recognizing âFrench impressionismâ in a piece of music heard on the radio or thinking âArt Decoâ when looking at a typeface in an advertisement.\nThe triggering of prior mental categories by some kind of input â whether sensory or more abstract â is, I insist, an act of analogy-making. Why is this? Because whenever a set of incoming stimuli activates one or more mental categories, some amount of slippage must occur (no instance of a category ever being precisely identical to a prior instance). Categories are quintessentially fluid entities; they adapt to a set of incoming stimuli and try to align themselves with it. The process of inexact matching between prior categories and new things being perceived (whether those âthingsâ are physical objects or bite-size events or grand sagas) is analogy-making par excellence. How could anyone deny this? After all, it is the mental mapping onto each other of two entities â one old and sound asleep in the recesses of long-term memory, the other new and gaily dancing on the mindâs center stage â that in fact differ from each other in a myriad of ways.\nThe Mental Lexicon: A Vast Storehouse of Triggerable Analogies\nWe humans begin life as rather austere analogy-makers â our set of categories is terribly sparse, and each category itself is hardly well-honed. Categories grow sharper and sharper and ever more flexible and subtle as we age, and of course fantastically more numerous. Many of our categories, though by no means all, are named by words or standard phrases shared with other people, and for the time being I will concentrate on those categories â categories that are named by so-called lexical items. The public labels of such categories â the lexical items themselves â come in many grades, ranging more or less as follows:\nSimple words:Â chair, clock, cork, cannon, crash, clown, clue, cloak, climber...\nCompound words:Â armchair, alarm clock, corkscrew, cannonball, skyscraper, station wagon, sexpot, salad dressing, school bus, jukebox, picket line, horror movie, wheeler-dealer...\nShort phrases:Â musical chairs, out of order, Christmas tree ornament, nonprofit organization, business hours, foregone conclusion, rush-hour traffic, country-Western music, welcome home, tell me about it, give me a break, and his lovely wife, second rate, swallow your pride...\nLonger phrases:Â stranded on a desert island; damned if you do, damned if you donât; praise the Lord and pass the ammunition; not in the foreseeable future; to the best of my knowledge; and they lived happily ever after; if it were up to me; havenât seen her since she was knee-high to a grasshopper; you could have knocked me over with a feather; thank you for not smoking; handed to him on a silver platter...\nSuch lists go on and on virtually forever, and yet the amazing fact is that few people have any inkling of the vastness of their mental lexicons (I owe a major debt here to Joe Becker â see Becker 1975). To be sure, most adults use their vast mental lexicons with great virtuosity, but they have stunningly little explicit awareness of what they are doing.\nIt was Roger Schank, I believe, who pointed out that we often use proverbs as what I would call âsituation labels,â by which I mean that when we perceive a situation, what often springs to mind, totally unbidden, is some proverb tucked away in our unconscious, and if we are talking to someone, we will quote that proverb, and our listener will in all likelihood understand very clearly how the proverb âfitsâ the situation-in other words, will effortlessly make the mapping (the analogy, to stress what it is that we are talking about here) between the phraseâs meaning and the situation. Thus the following kinds of phrases can easily be used as situation labels:\nThatâs the pot calling the kettle black if I ever saw it!\nIt just went in one ear and out the other...\nSpeak of the devil!\nWhen the catâs away the mice will play!\nThe Common Core behind a Lexical Item\nI now make an observation that, though banal and obvious, needs to be made explicitly nonetheless â namely, things âout thereâ (objects, situations, whatever) that are labeled by the same lexical item have something, some core, in common; also, whatever it is that those things âout thereâ share is shared with the abstract mental structure that lurks behind the label used for them. Getting to the core of things is, after all, what categories are for. In fact, I would go somewhat further and claim that getting to the core of things is what thinking itself is for-thus once again placing high-level perception front and center in the definition of cognition.\n[]()The noun âshadowâ offers a good example of the complexity and subtlety of structure that lurks behind not just some lexical items, but behind every single one. Note, first of all, the subtle difference between âshadowâ and âshadeâ: we do not speak of cattle seeking shadow on a hot day, but shade. Many languages do not make this distinction, and thus they offer their native speakers a set of categories that is tuned slightly differently.\n![shadow](https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/images/light_shadow.jpg)\nIn many parts of the world, there are arid zones that lie just to the east of mountain ranges (e.g., the desert in Oregon just to the east of the Cascade mountains); these regions are standardly referred to as the mountain chainâs ârain shadow.â![rain shadow](https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/images/rain_shadow.jpg)\nWhat does one call the roughly circular patch of green seen underneath a tree after a snowfall? It could clearly be called a âsnow shadowâ â the region where snow failed to fall, having been blocked by an object.\n![snow shadow](https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/images/snow_shadow.jpg)\nA young woman who aspires to join her high-school swimming team, but whose mother was an Olympic swimmer, can be said to be âin the shadow of her mother.â In fact, if she joins the team and competes, she might even be said to be âswimming in the shadow of her mother.â And if she performs less well than her mother did, she will be said to be âovershadowedâ by her mother.\nOne might say about a man who has had a bout with cancer but has recovered and is now feeling more secure about his health, âHe is finally feeling more or less out of the shadow of his cancer.â Along similar lines, many countries in Europe have recovered, to a large extent, from the ravages of World War II, but some might still be said to lie âin the shadow of World War II.â\nAnother type of shadow cast by World War II (or by any war) lies in the skewed population distribution of any decimated group; that is, one imagines the human population as constituting a kind of flow of myriad tiny entities (individual people) down through the years (like that of photons or snowflakes through space), but long after the warâs end, there are certain âregionsâ of humanity (e.g., certain ethnic groups) where the flow of births has been greatly reduced, much as if by an âobstacleâ (namely, the millions of deaths in prior generations, whose effect continues to reverberate for many decades before gradually fading away, as a groupâs population replenishes itself).\nThere is of course no sharp line between cases where a word like âshadowâ is used conventionally and cases where it is used in a novel manner; although ârain shadowâ is something of a standard phrase, âsnow shadowâ (even though it is far easier to see) is less common. And notions like that of âpopulation shadowâ mentioned at the end are probably novel to most readers of this article, even though a closely related notion like âin the shadow of the warâ is probably not new.\nIn short, the domain of the word âshadowâ is a blurry region in semantic space, as is any human category, and â here I hark back to my initial refrain â that blur is due to the subtleties of mapping situations onto other situations-due, in other words, to the human facility of making analogies. The point is, a concept is a package of analogies.\nComplex Lexical Items as Names of Complex Categories\nOver the next few pages I will present a potpourri of mental categories (via proxies â namely, their English-language lexical-item representations); I invite you to think, as you consider each item, just what it is that very different exemplars of the category in question tend to have in common. Thus:\ndog\nbacklog\nprobably\nprobab-lee!\nI interrupt the list momentarily to comment on the last two entries, which of course are not nouns. (Who says nouns are the only mental categories? Obviously, verbs represent categories as well-but the same holds true, no less, for adjectives, adverbs, and so forth.) Some situations call forth the word âprobablyâ; most do not. To some situations, the concept behind the word âprobablyâ simply fits, while to most, it does not fit. We learn how to use the word âprobablyâ over the course of years in childhood, until it becomes so ingrained that it never crosses our mind that âprobablyâ is the name that English speakers give to a certain category of situations; it simply is evoked effortlessly and rapidly by those situations, and it is uttered without any conscious thought as to how it applies. It just âseems rightâ or âsounds right.â\nWhat, then, about the word below it: âprobab-leeâ?Â This, too, is a lexical item in the minds of most native speakers of contemporary American English â perhaps not often used, perhaps more commonly heard than uttered by readers of this article, but nonetheless, we native speakers of American English all relate to hearing the word âprobablyâ accented on its final rather than its initial syllable, and we all somehow realize the connotations hidden therein, though they may be terribly hard to articulate. I wonât try to articulate them myself, but I would merely point out that this phonetic variant of the word âprobablyâ fits only certain situations and not others (where the âsituationâ includes, needless to say, not just what is being talked about but also the mood of the speaker, and the speakerâs assessment of the mood of the listener as well). Example: âAre our stupid leaders ever going to learn their lesson?â âWho knows? Maybe theyâre doomed to keep on repeating the mistakes of the past.â âMmm... Probab-lee...â\nMy point, with all the phrases cited above, is to bring to your conscious awareness the fact that there are certain situations that one could call âprobab-lee!Â situationsâ no less than there are certain situations that are âmusical-chairs situationsâ or âspeak-of-the-devil situations.â In short, lexical items can be very abstract categories evoked by special classes of situations and not by others. This applies to adjective, adverbs, prepositions, interjections, short and long phrases, and so on. Thus let me continue my list.\nCome on!\nGo for it!\nItâs about time!\n[Well, excuuuuuuuuuuse me!](https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/imagegallery.html#stevemartin)\nLetâs not stand on ceremony!\nwithout batting an eyelash\nainât\nLest the lowest item above seem puzzling, let me point out that the notorious contraction âainât,â although it is in a certain sense ungrammatical and improper, is nonetheless used very precisely, like pinpoint bombing, by politicians, reporters, university presidents, and the like, who carefully and deliberately insert it into their speech at well-timed moments when they know their audience almost expects it-it fits the context perfectly. For example, a general trying to justify a bombing raid might say, in describing the series of deadly skirmishes that provoked it, âIâm sorry, but a Sunday picnic it just ainât.â This is just one of many types of âainâtâ situations. We native speakers know them when we hear them, and we likewise have a keen ear for improper uses of the word âainâtâ by educated people, even if we ainât capable of putting our finger on what makes them inappropriate. (Curiously enough, shortly after drafting this paragraph, I came across an article in theÂ New York TimesÂ about the failure of a test missile to hit its target, and a perfectly straight photo caption started out, âTwo out of four goals ainât bad...â As I said above, even the most highly placed sources will use this âungrammaticalâ word without batting an eyelash.)\nâSuggestionsâ Imparted on the Soccer Field\nAs a nonnative speaker of Italian watching the 1998 Soccer World Cup on Italian television, I was struck by the repeated occurrence of a certain term in the rapid-fire speech of all the commentators: the wordÂ suggerimentoÂ (literally, âsuggestionâ). They kept on describing players as having givenÂ suggerimentiÂ to other players. It was clear from the start that aÂ suggerimentoÂ was not a verbal piece of advice (a suggestion in the most literal sense), but rather some kind of pass from one player to another as they advanced downfield. But what kind of pass was it exactly? By no means were all passes calledÂ suggerimenti;Â this term was dearly reserved for events that seemed to have some kind of scoring potential to them, as if one player was wordlessly saying to another, âHere now â take this and go for it!â\nBut how does a sports announcer unconsciously and effortlessly distinguish this kind of pass from other passes that in many ways look terribly similar? When is this kind of nonverbal âsuggestionâ being given by one player to another? I sensed that this must be a subtle judgment call, that thereâs no black-and-white line separatingÂ suggerimentiÂ from mereÂ passaggi,Â but that nonetheless there is a kind of core to the concept ofÂ suggerimentoÂ that all Italian announcers and keen Italian observers of soccer would agree on, and that there are fringes of the category, where some people might feel the word applied and others would not. Such blurriness is the case, of course, with every mental category, ranging from âchairâ to âwheeler-dealerâ to âpot calling the kettle black,â but sinceÂ suggerimentoÂ was not in my native language and thus I had been forced to grapple with it explicitly and consciously, it was an excellent example of the view of lexical items that I am herein trying to impart to my readers.\nPolysemy and the Nonspherical Shapes of Concepts\nIt would be naive to imagine that each lexical item defines a perfectly âsphericalâ region in conceptual space, as pristine as an atomic nucleus surrounded by a spherical electron cloud whose density gradually attenuates with increasing distance from the core. Although the single-nucleus spherical-cloud image has some truth to it, a more accurate image of what lies behind a typical lexical item might be that of a molecule with two, three, or more nuclei that share an irregularly shaped electron cloud. .\nSuggerimentoÂ provides a perfect example of such a molecule, with one of its constituent atoms being the notion of a verbal piece of advice, another the notion of prompting on a theater stage, yet a third being the notion of a certain type of downfield soccer pass, and so forth. There is something in common, of course, that these all share, but they are nonetheless distinguishable regions in conceptual space.\nOften native speakers of a language have a hard time realizing that two notions labeled identically in their language are seen as highly distinct concepts by speakers of other languages. Thus, native speakers of English feel the verb âto knowâ as a monolithic concept, and are sometimes surprised to find out that in other languages, one verb is used for knowing facts, a different verb for knowing people, and there may even be a third verb for knowing how to do things. When they are first told this, they are able to see the distinction, although it may seem highly finicky and pointless; with practice, however, they build up more refined categories until a moment may come when what once seemed an unnatural and gratuitous division of mental space now seems to offer a useful contrast between rather distinct notions. And conversely, speakers of a language where all three of these notions are represented by distinct lexical items may find it revelatory, fascinating, and perhaps even elegant to see how they are all subsumed under one umbrella-word in English.\nMy main point in bringing this up is simply to make explicit the fact that words and concepts are far from being regularly shaped convex regions in mental space; polysemy (the possession of multiple meanings) and metaphor make the regions complex and idiosyncratic. The simplest concepts are like isolated islands in a sea; the next-simplest are like pairs of islands joined by a narrow isthmus; then there are trios with two or three isthmuses having various widths; and so on. Caveat: When I say âsimplest concepts,â I do not mean those concepts that we pick up earliest in life, but in fact quite the contrary. After all, the majority of concepts planted in earliest childhood grow and grow over a lifetime and turn into the most frequently encountered concepts, whose elaborate ramifications and tendrils constitute the highest degree of twistiness! What I mean by âsimplest conceptâ is merely âconcept with maximally simple shapeâ; such a âsimpleâ concept would most likely owe its simplicity precisely to its low frequency, and thus would seem like a sophisticated adult concept, such as âphotosynthesisâ or âhyperbola.â\nConceptual Families and Lexical Rivalry\nWalking down the corridors of a building in Italy in which I have worked over several summers, I have been faced innumerable times with an interesting problem in high-level perception that has to be solved in real time â in a couple of seconds at most, usually. That is, how do I greet each person who I recognize as we approach each other in the hall, and then pass? Here are five sample levels of greeting (there are dozens more, needless to say):\nBuon giorno!Â (âHello!â or perhaps âMorning.â)\nSalve!Â (âHowdy!â or perhaps âHow are you.â)\nBuondÃ¬!Â (Perhaps âTop oâ the morninâ!â or âHow ya doinâ?â)\nCiao!Â (âHi!â or âHi there!â)\nCome stai?Â (âHow are you doing?â or perhaps âWhatâs up?â)\nEach of them conveys a particular level of mutual acquaintance and a particular position along the formality/informality spectrum. And of course it frequently happens that I recognize someone but canât even remember how often Iâve met them before (let alone remember what their name is or what their role is), and so I have to make a decision that somehow will allow me to cover at least two different levels of friendliness (since Iâm really not sure how friendly we are!). The choice is incredibly subtle and depends on dozens if not hundreds of variables, all unconsciously felt and all slightly contributing to a âvoteâ among my neurons, which then allow just one of these terms (or some other term) to come bubbling up out of my dormant Italian mental lexicon.\nConsider the following spectrum of phrases all having in a certain sense âthe same meaning,â but ranging from very vulgar to somewhat incensed to quite restrained to utterly bland:\nHe didnât give a flying f*** .\nHe didnât give a good God damn.\nHe didnât give a tinkerâs damn.\nHe didnât give a damn.\nHe didnât give a darn.\nHe didnât give a hoot.\nHe didnât care at all.\nHe didnât mind.\nHe was indifferent.\nFor many native speakers, there are situations that correspond to each of these levels of intensity. To be sure, some speakers might be loath to utter certain of these phrases, but true native-level mastery nonetheless entails a keen awareness of when each of them might be called for in, say, a movie, or simply coming out of the mouth of someone else. After all, a large part of native mastery of a language is deeply knowing how other people use the language, regardless of whether one oneself uses certain phrases. And thus, to reiterate our theme, there are âHe-didnât-give-a-good-God-damn situationsâ and there are situations of a very different sort, which could be called âHe-didnât-care-at-all situations,â and so forth. Each of the above expressions, then, can be thought of as the name of a particular type of situation, but since these categories are much closer to each other than just randomly chosen categories, they constitute potential rivalries that may take place during the ultra-fast high-level perceptual act that underlies speech.\nLexical Blends as a Window onto the Mind\nLexical blends, which are astonishingly common though very seldom noticed by speakers or by listeners, reveal precisely this type of unconscious competition among close relatives in the mental lexicon. A lexical blend occurs when a situation evokes two or more lexical items at once and fragments of the various evoked competitors wind up getting magically, sometimes seamlessly, spliced together into the vocalized output stream (see, for example, Hofstadter and Moser 1989). Occasionally the speaker catches such an error on its way out and corrects it, though just as often it goes totally unheard by all parties. Thus people make blends of the following sorts:\nWord-level blends: mop/broom => brop\nPhrase-level blends: easygoing/happy-go-lucky => easy-go-lucky\nSentence-level blends: Weâll leave no stone unturned/Weâll pull out all the stops => Weâll pull no stops unturned.\nBlends reveal how much goes on beneath the surface as our brains try to figure out how to label simpler and more [[complex situations]]. In a way, what is amazing is that blends are not more common. Somehow, through some kind of cerebral magic, speakers light most of the time upon just one lexical label despite the existence of many potential ones, rather than coming out with a mishmosh of several â much as when a good pianist plays the piano, it is very seldom that two keys are struck at once, even though it might seem, a priori, that striking two neighboring keys at once ought to happen very often.\nA Lexical Item as One Side of a Perceptual Analogy\nAt the risk of boring some readers, I shall now continue with my rather arbitrary sampler of lexical items, just to drive the point home that every lexical item that we possess is a mental category, and hence, restating what I earlier claimed, every lexical item, when used in speech (whether received or transmitted), constitutes one side of an analogy being made in real time in the speakerâs/listenerâs mind. I thus urge readers to try on for size the mindset that equates a lexical item with the ânameâ of a certain blurry set of situations centered on some core. Though this sounds quite orthodox for nouns, it is less so for verbs, and when applied to many of the following linguistic expressions, it is highly unorthodox:\nslippery slope\nsafety net\nshades of...\nBeen there, done that.\nForget it!\nIt was touch-and-go.\ntake a turn for the worse\nBe my guest!\nMake my day!\nFancy that!\nPut your money where your mouth is!\nI mean,...\nWell,...\nDonât tell me that...\nItâs fine to [do X] and all, but...\nkind of [+ adj.]\nwhen it comes to the crunch...\nYou canât have it both ways!\n...thatâs for sure!\nthe flip side [of the coin] is...\nYou had to be there.\nItâs high time that...\nWhatever!\nConsider the teenagerâs favorite rejoinder, âWhatever!â If one were to try to capture its meaning â its range of applicability â one might paraphrase it somewhat along these lines: âYou think such and so, and I disagree, but letâs just agree to disagree and move on...â It takes a good number of years before one has acquired the various pieces of cognitive equipment that underpin the proper usage of such a phrase (which again ties in with the fact that one cannot remember events from oneâs babyhood).\nHigh-Level Mental Chunks That Lack Labels\nAlthough long stock phrases like âPut your money where your mouth is!â might seem to stretch the notion of mental chunking to the limit, thatâs hardly the case. Indeed, such phrases lie closer to the beginning than to the end of the story, for each one of use also remembers many thousands of events in our personal lives that are so large and so idiosyncratic that no one has ever given them a name and no one ever will, and yet they nonetheless are sharp memories and are revealed for the mental categories they are by the fact that they are summoned up cleanly and clearly by certain situations that take place later, often many years later. Thus take this one sample mental chunk, from my own personal usually dormant repertoire:\nthat time I spent an hour or two hoping that my old friend Robert, who I hadnât seen in two years but who was supposed to arrive from Germany by train sometime during that summer day in the little Danish fishing village of Frederikssund (which in a series of letters he and I had mutually picked out on maps, and in which I had just arrived early that morning after driving all night from Stockholm), might spot me as I lurked way out at the furthest tip of the very long pier, rather than merely bumping into me at random as we both walked around exploring the stores and streets and parks of this unknown hamlet\nAs its length suggests, this is a very detailed personal memory from many years ago (and indeed, I have merely sketched it for readers here I could write pages about it), and might at first seem to be nothing at all like a mental category. And yet, how else can one explain the fact that the image of myself standing at pierâs end tingling with unrealistic hope jumped instantly to mind some fifteen years later as I was idly seeking to rearrange the eight letters in the last name of Janet Kolodner, a new acquaintance, in such a way that they would spell a genuine English word? Without success, I had tried dozens of fairly âobviousâ pathways, such as ârendlook,â âleodronk,â and âondorkle,â when out of the blue it occurred to me that the initial consonant cluster âknâ, with its cleverly silent âk,â might be the key to success, and I started excitedly trying this âbrilliant idea.â However, after exploring this strategy for a while, I realized, to my chagrin, that no matter how lovely it would be if the silent âkâ were to yield a solution, the probabilities for such a clever coup were rapidly diminishing. And at the precise instant that this realization hit, the Frederikssund-pier image came swooshing up out of memory, an image to which I had devoted not even a split second of thought for many years.\nThere was, of course, a perfectly logical reason behind this sudden resurfacing â namely, a strong and rich analogy in which the mundane idea of merely walking around the fishing village mapped onto the mundane exploration of ârendlookâ and cousins, in which the âromanticâ idea of lingering way out at the tip of the pier mapped onto the âromanticâ hope for an anagram beginning with the tricky âknâ cluster, and in which the growing recognition of the likelihood of failure of the more unlikely, more âromanticâ strategies was the common core that bound the two otherwise remote events together.\nThe Central Cognitive Loop\nAbstract remindings of this sort have been noted here and there in the cognitive-science literature, and some attempts have been made to explain them (e.g., Roger SchankâsÂ Dynamic MemoryÂ [1982]), but their starring role in the phenomenon of cognition has not, to my knowledge, been claimed. It is my purpose to stake that claim.\nTo make the claim more explicit, I must posit that such a large-scale memory chunk can be thought of as being stored in long-term memory as a ânodeâ â that is, something that can be retrieved as a relatively discrete and separable whole, or to put it metaphorically, something that can be pulled like a fish out of the deep, dark brine of dormant memory. Once this âfishâ has been pulled out, it is thrown in the âbucketâ of short-term memory (often calling âworking memoryâ), where it is available for scrutiny.\nScrutiny consists in the act of âunpackingâ the node to some degree, which means that inside it are found other nodes linked together by some fabric of relationships, and this process of unpacking can then be continued recursively, given that the contents of unpacked nodes themselves are placed in short-term memory as well, and hence are themselves subject to more detailed scrutiny, if so desired. (I suppose one could extend the fishing analogy by imagining that smaller fish are found in the stomach of the first fish caught, as it is âcleanedâ â and so forth, recursively. But that fanciful and somewhat gory image is not crucial to my story.)\nThus, if it is placed under scrutiny, inside the âFrederikssund pierâ node can be found nodes for the exchange of letters that preceded Robertâs and my Danish reunion, for Frederikssund itself, for my Stockholm drive, for Robertâs train trip, for a few of the townâs streets and shops, for the pier, for my growing disappointment, and so on. Not all of these will be placed into short-term memory each time the event as a whole is recalled, nor will the inner structure of those nodes that are placed there necessarily be looked into, although it is quite possible that some of their inner structure will be examined.\nThus the unpacking process of this kind of high-level unlabeled node (such as the âFrederikssund pierâ node or the âKolodner anagramâ node) can fill short-term memory with a large number of interrelated structures. It must be stressed, however, that the unpacking process is highly context-dependent (i.e., sensitive to what concepts have been recently activated), and hence will yield a somewhat different filling-up of short-term memory on each occasion that the same high-level node is pulled up out of the ocean of long-term memory.\nOnce there are structures in short-term memory, then the perceptual process can be directed at any of them (this is, in fact, the kind of high-level perception that forms the core of the Copycat and Tabletop models of analogy-making â see Hofstadter and FARG 1995), the upshot of which will be the activation â thanks to analogy â of further nodes in long-term memory, which in turn causes new âfishâ to be pulled out of that brine and placed into short-term memoryâs bucket. What we have described is, in short, the following central cognitive loop:\nA long-term memory node is accessed, transferred to short-term memory and there unpacked to some degree, which yields new structures to be perceived, and the high-level perceptual act activates yet further nodes, which are then in turn accessed, transferred, unpacked, etc., etc.\nAn Illustration of the Central Cognitive Loop in Action\nThe foregoing may seem too abstract and vague, and so to make the ideas more concrete, I now will present a dialogue most of which actually took place, but some of which has been added on, so as to make some points emerge a little more clearly. The fact, however, that it all sounds perfectly normal is what matters â it certainly could pass for spontaneous cognition in the minds of two speakers. The dialogue exemplifies all the processes so far described, and â at least to my mind â shows how these processes are what drives thought. So here is the dialogue.\nA and B are walking by a church when A looks up and notices that on the steeple, there are some objects that look like emergency-warning sirens attached to the base of the cross.\nA:Â Hey, fancy that! Shades of âPraise the Lord and pass the ammunition!â\nB:Â What do you mean?\nA:Â Well, itâs kind of amusing to me. On the one hand, the cross implies a belief in protection by the Lord, but on the other hand, the sirens suggest the need for a backup system, some kind of safety net. I mean, itâs fine to believe in divine protection and all, but when it really comes to the crunch, religious peopleâs true colors emerge...\nB:Â Well, sooner safe than sorry, no?\nA:Â Sure, but isnât a cross wrapped in danger sirens kind of hypocritical? I mean, why donât religious people put their money where their mouth is? If they really believe in Godâs benevolence, if they really have the courage of their own convictions, then how come it doesnât suffice to speak softly â why do they need to carry a big stick as well? Put it this way: Either youâre a believer, or you ainât.\nB:Â Thatâs a bit black-and-white, isnât it?\nA:Â Of course! As it should be! You canât have it both ways. Somehow this reminds me of when I had to leave my bags in a hotel in Italy for a few days, and the hotel people stored them in a tiny little chapel that was part of the hotel. A friend joked, âWell, this way theyâll be protected.â But why is such a remark so clearly a joke, even to religious people? Arenât churches houses of God? Shouldnât a sacred place be a safer place?\nB:Â Yes, but being sacred doesnât make churches immune to disaster. Weâve all heard so often of churches whose roofs collapse on the assembled parishioners...\nA:Â Exactly. And then pious people always say, âThe Lord works in mysterious ways... Itâs beyond our comprehension.â Well, how they can continue to believe after such an event is beyond my comprehension, thatâs for sure.\nB:Â Youâre talking about people who claim to believe but in some sense act as if they donât really believe, deep down. But then thereâs the flip side of the coin: people who claim not to believe but act in a way as if they do. The reverse type of hypocrite, in sort.\nA:Â Do you have an example in mind?\nB:Â Yes â Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist. I once read that in his house there was a horseshoe hanging over one door, and someone asked him, âWhatâs this all about?â Bohr answered, âWell, horseshoes are supposed to bring good luck, so we put it up there.â The friend then said, âCome now â surely you donât believe it brings good luck, do you?â Bohr laughed and said, âOf course not!â And then he added, âBut they say it works even if you donât believe in it.â\nA:Â I see your point â in a way Bohrâs remark is the flip side of âPraise the Lord and pass the ammunition.â In the trench-warfare case, you have a believer whose actions reveal deep doubts about their proclaimed belief, and in the Bohr case, you have a skeptic whose actions reveal that he may doubt his own skepticism. But that cross with the sirens â I just canât believe that they would wrap them around the cross, of all things â thatâs the height of irony! I mean, itâs like some priest whoâs going into a dangerous area of town and doesnât just carry a handgun along in case of need, but in fact a cross that doubles as a handgun.\nB:Â Youâve made the irony rather clear, I agree. But tell me â would you propose that the pope, simply because heâs a big-time believer in God, should travel through the worldâs cities without any protection? Would you propose that true believers, if they are to be self-consistent, shouldnât put locks on their churches?\nA:Â Well, wonât God take care of his flock? Especially the pope?\nB:Â Itâs not that simple.\nA:Â Come on â if God doesnât look after the pope, who does he look after?\nB:Â Come on, yourself! They crucified Jesus, didnât they? If anyone should have had divine immunity, it was Jesus â but he didnât. And yet that in itself doesnât mean that Jesus wasnât Godâs son.\nThis exchange illustrates all of the themes so far presented. In the first place, it shows A and B using ordinary words â bite-size lexical items such as âcross,â âsirens,â âbags,â âhotel,â âwhen,â âpeople,â and dozens more â nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and so forth. Nothing unusual here, of course, except that readers are being exhorted to picture each of these words as the tip of an iceberg that hides a myriad hidden analogies â namely, the analogies that collectively allowed the category to come into being in the first place in the speakerâs or listenerâs or readerâs mind.\nIn the second place, the dialogue shows a good number of the shorter phrases cited in lists above being used in realistic situations â smallish stock phrases such as âFancy that!â âkind of,â âI mean,â âainât,â âthatâs for sure,â and many more. These phrases are used by speakers because they meet the rhetorical needs of the particular context, and when perceived by listeners they activate familiar rhetorical-context categories.\nIn the third place, the dialogue illustrates high-level perception â the retrieval of high-level labels for perceptions â such as AâsÂ opening statement, in which the lexical item âPraise and Lord and pass the ammunitionâ is the effortlessly evoked label for a church cross with warning sirens attached to it. In fact, all through the dialogue, the participants use large lexical items to label situations that are being categorized in real time in their minds. Thus we hear âbackup system,â âsafety net,â âwhen it really comes to the crunch,â âflip side of the coin,â âput your money where your mouth is,â âsooner safe than sorry,â âspeak softly and carry a big stick,â âblack-and-white,â and many more.\nIn the fourth place, we have large-scale remindings. First there is the shift from the cross-wrapped-in-sirens scene to the suitcases-left-in-hotel-chapel situation, then the shift to the collapsing-churches scenario, after which comes the shift, mediated by a kind of conceptual reversal, to Niels Bohrâs horseshoe-that-works-despite-skepticism (probably an apocryphal story, by the way). Following that image comes a different kind of shift â an analogy where a given, known scenario is compared with a spontaneously concocted hypothetical scenario â thus, for instance, the cross-wrapped-in-sirens scene is compared with a hypothetical cross/handgun blend. This is swiftly followed by a trio of further concocted analogues: first the pope traveling without protection, then churches that are left unlocked, and finally God not even taking care of his own son.\nThe Central Cognitive Loop in Isolation and in Interaction\nThe broad-stroke pathway meandering through the limitless space of potential ideas during the hypothetical conversation of A and B is due to various actual scenes or imagined scenarios being reperceived, in light of recently activated concepts, in novel fashions and thereby triggering dormant memories, which are then fished up from dormancy to center stage (i.e., short-term memory), where, partially unpacked, they are in turn subjected to the exact same context-dependent reperception process. Around and around in such a loop, alternating between fishing in long-term memory and unpacking and reperceiving in short-term memory, rolls the process of cognition.\nNote that what I have just described is not problem-solving, which has traditionally played such a large role in modeling of thought and been tightly linked with âanalogical reasoningâ; no, everyday thought is not problem-solving or anything that resembles it at all; rather, it is a nonrandom stroll through long-term memory, mediated by high-level perception (which is simply, to echo myself, another name for analogy-making).\nTo be sure, thought does not generally take place in a sealed-off vat or an isolation chamber; most of the time, external events are constantly impinging on us. Therefore the purely self-driven flow that the âcentral loopâ would suggest is just half of the story â it is the contribution from within oneâs private cognitive system. The other half â the contribution from outside â comes from inanimate objects impinging on oneâs senses (skyscrapers and sunsets and splashes, for instance), from animate agents seen mostly as objects (mosquitos that one swats at, people that one tries not to bang into as one hastens down a crowded sidewalk), or from other cognitive agents (conversations with friends, articles read in the paper, email messages, scenes in movies, and so on).\nThis buzzing, booming confusion in which one is immersed most of the time tends to obscure the constant running of the private inner loop â but when one retreats into solitude, when one starts to ponder or daydream, when one tries to close oneself off from these external impingements and to be internally driven, that is when the above-posited âcentral loop of cognitionâ assumes the dominant role.\nGoal-Drivenness and the Central Loop\nWhere do goals enter this picture? How does the deeply goal-driven nature of human thought emerge from what might seem to be the randomness of the posited central loop? The answer resides in the enormously biased nature of each individualâs perception.\nEach person, as life progresses, develops a set of high-level concepts that they tend to favor, and their perception is continually seeking to cast the world in terms of those concepts. The perceptual process is thus far from neutral or random, but rather it seeks, whenever possible, to employ high-level concepts that one is used to, that one believes in, that one is comfortable with, that are oneâs pet themes. If the current perception of a situation leads one into a state of cognitive dissonance, then one goes back and searches for a new way to perceive it. Thus the avoidance of mental discomfort â the avoidance of cognitive dissonance â constitutes a powerful internal force that helps to channel the central loop in what amounts to a strongly goal-driven manner.\nThe Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: Language and the Central Loop\nThe viewpoint I have been proposing here â in most ways quite unrevolutionary! â can be rephrased in terms of âperceptual attractors,â which are long-term mental loci that are zoomed into when situations are encountered (see Kanerva 1988). We all have many thousands of such attractors in our dormant memories, only a tiny fraction of which are accessed when we encounter a new situation. Where do such attractors come from? How public are they? Do they have explicit labels? Here I list three main types:\nStandard lexical items (words, names, phrases, proverbs, etc.) provided to a vast public through a shared linguistic environment\nShared vicarious experiences provided to a vast public through the media (e.g., places, personages, and events of small and large scale in books, movies, television shows, and so on), the smaller of which have explicit linguistic labels, the more complex of which have none\nUnique personal memories, lacking any fixed linguistic labels (such chunks are generally very large. and complex, like the Frederikssund memory discussed above, or even far larger events, such as a favorite high-school class, a year spent in a special city, a protracted divorce, and so on)\nSince a sizable fraction of oneâs personal repertoire of perceptual chunks is provided from without, by oneâs language and culture, this means that inevitably language and culture exert powerful, even irresistible, channeling influences on how one frames events. (This position is related to the âmemeâs-eye viewâ of the nature of thought, as put forth in numerous venues, most recently in Blackmore 1999.)\nConsider, for instance, such words as âbacklog,â âburnout,â âmicromanaging,â and âunderachiever,â all of which are commonplace in todayâs America. I chose these particular words because I suspect that what they designate can be found not only here and now, but as well in distant cultures and epochs, quite in contrast to such culturally and temporally bound terms as âsoap opera,â âmini-series,â âcouch potato,â ânews anchor,â âhit-and-run driver,â and so forth, which owe their existence to recent technological developments. So consider the first set of words. We Americans living at the millenniumâs cusp perceive backlogs of all sorts permeating our lives â but we do so because the word is there, warmly inviting us to see them. But back in, say, Johann Sebastian Bachâs day, were there backlogs â or more precisely, were backlogs perceived? For that matter, did Bach ever experience burnout? Well, most likely he did â but did he know that he did? Or did some of his Latin pupils strike him as being underachievers? Could he see this quality without being given the label? Or, moving further afield, do Australian aborigines resent it when their relatives micromanage their lives? Of course, I could have chosen hundreds of other terms that have arisen only recently in our century, yet that designate aspects of life that were always around to be perceived but, for one reason or another, aroused little interest, and hence were neglected or overlooked.\nMy point is simple: we are prepared to see, and we see easily, things for which our language and culture hand us ready-made labels. When those labels are lacking, even though the phenomena may be all around us, we may quite easily fail to see them at all. The perceptual attractors that we each possess (some coming from without, some coming from within, some on the scale of mere words, some on a much grander scale) are the filters through which we scan and sort reality, and thereby they determine what we perceive on high and low levels.\nAlthough this sounds like an obvious tautology, that part of it that concerns words is in fact a nontrivial proposition, which, under the controversial banner of âSapir-Whorf hypothesis,â has been heatedly debated, and to a large extent rejected, over the course of the twentieth century. I myself was once most disdainful of this hypothesis, but over time came to realize how deeply human thought â even my own! â is channeled by habit and thus, in the last accounting, by the repertoire of mental chunks (i.e., perceptual attractors) that are available to the thinker. I now think that it is high time for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis to be reinstated, at least in its milder forms.\nLanguage, Brains, and âJust Adding Waterâ\nThe usual goal of communication is, of course, to set up âthe same thoughtâ in the receiverâs brain as is currently taking place in the senderâs brain. The mode by which such replication is attempted is essentially a drastic compression of the complex symbolic dance occurring in the senderâs brain into a temporal chain of sounds or a string of visual signs, which are then absorbed by the receiverâs brain, where, by something like the reverse of said compression â a process that I will here term âjust adding waterâ â a new symbolic dance is launched in the second brain. The human brain at one end drains the water out to produce âpowdered food for thought,â and the one at the other end adds the water back, to produce full-fledged food for thought.\nTake, for instance, the paragraph given a few pages back:\nthat time I spent an hour or two hoping that my old friend Robert, who I hadnât seen in two years but who was supposed to arrive from Germany by train sometime during that summer day in the little Danish fishing village of Frederikssund (which in a series of letters he and I had mutually picked out on maps, and in which I had just arrived early that morning after driving all night from Stockholm), might spot me as I lurked way out at the furthest tip of the very long pier, rather than merely bumping into me at random as we both walked around exploring the stores and streets and parks of this unknown hamlet\nObviously, this set of black marks on a white background is not similar to the time I spent in Frederikssund, nor is any part of it similar to a pier, a drive from Stockholm, a body of water, or dashed hopes. And yet these marks triggered in your brain a symbolic dance so vivid that you saw, in your mindâs eye, a fishing village, two young friends, their joyful anticipation of a semirandom reunion, a pier stretching far out into a gulf, a barely visible person anxiously pacing at its tip, and so on. A never-before-danced dance inside your brain, launched by a unique set of squiggly shapes, makes you feel almost as if you had been there; had I spelled it out with another page or two of intricate black-on-white patterns, it would feel all the more vivid. This is a wonderful kind of transportation of ideas between totally different media â uprooting ideas from one garden and replanting them in a garden never even imagined before, where they flourish beautifully.\nTransportation\nIn his bookÂ The poetics of translationÂ (Barnstone 1993), poet and translator Willis Barnstone has a section called âThe Parable of the Greek Moving Van,â where he points out that on the side of all Greek moving vans is written the word Î¼ÎµÏÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¬ (phonetically âmetaforaâ and semantically âtransportationâ). He then observes:\nTo come to Greece and find that even the moving vans run around under the sun and smog of greater Athens with advertisements for transportation, for metaphor, and ultimately with signs for translation should convince us that every motor truck hauling goods from one place to another, every perceived metamorphosis of a word or phrase within or between languages, every decipherment and interpretation of a text, every role by each actor in the cast, every adaptation of a script by a director of opera, film, theater, ballet, pantomime, indeed every perception of movement and change, in the street or on our tongues, on the page or in our ears, leads us directly to the art and activity of translation.\nI pack my mental goods down into tight, neat bundles, I load them as carefully as I can into the metafora truck of language, it drives from my brain to yours, and then you unpack. What a metaphor for communication! And yet it has often been said that all communication, all language, is metaphorical. Since I believe that metaphor and analogy are the same phenomenon, it would follow that I believe that all communication is via analogy. Indeed, I would describe communication this way: taking an intricate dance that can be danced in one and only one medium, and then, despite the intimacy of the marriage of that dance to that medium, making a radically new dance that is intimately married to a radically different medium, and in just the same way as the first dance was to its medium.\nTrans-Sportation\nTo make this all a little more concrete, let us consider taking a complex dance done in the medium of the sport of basketball and trans-sporting that dance into the rather different medium of the sport of soccer. Indeed, imagine taking the most enthralling basketball game you ever watched â perhaps a championship game you saw on television â and giving a videotape of that game to a âsoccer choreographer,â who will now stage all the details of an artificial soccer game that is in some sense analogous to your basketball game. Of course this could be done in many ways, some conservative and some daring.\nSome choreographers, citing irreconcilable differences between the two sports (for instance, the difference in the number of players per team, the lack of any counterpart to a goalie in basketball, the low frequency of scoring in soccer relative to basketball, and on and on), might severely bend the rules of soccer, creating a game with only five players on a team, taking away the goalies, vastly reducing the size of the field (and the goals), and so forth, thus effectively creating a hybrid soccer-basketball game that looks very much like basketball, only it is played on grass and involves propelling the ball with the lower rather than the upper limbs. When one watched the reenactment of oneâs favorite basketball game in this artificial medium, one would not have the sense of watching a soccer game but of watching a very distorted basketball game.\nOther choreographers, more willing to go out on a limb, would retain the normal rules of soccer but would attempt to stage a game whose every play felt like a particular play of the original basketball game, even though eleven players were retained on a side, even though the goals remained huge compared to baskets, even though there were still goalies, even though the goals might be coming a little too thick and fast, and so forth. There would be plays that would be essentially like slam-dunks while at the same time looking every bit like normal soccer plays. In such a case, one would feel one was watching a genuine soccer game â perhaps a peculiar one in some ways, but nonetheless genuine. In the ideal case, one could have the two counterpart games running on side-by-side television screens, and a âneutralâ commentator using only terms that apply to both sports could be effectively heard as describing either of the games.\nAnything in between these two extreme philosophies of âtrans-sportationâ can also be imagined â and just such a bizarre scenario is what I think everyday communication is actually like. Two brains are, in general, far more unalike than are the sports of soccer and basketball â and yet our society is predicated on mutual comprehensibility mediated by language.\nTranslation\nIt is astonishing to me how often people â even linguistically sophisticated people, such as philosophers, writers, linguists, translators, and cognitive scientists â will speak as if communication among members of a single language community were total and perfect, with serious communication gaps only taking place at the interface between different languages â as if translation were needed only between languages, never within a language community. Thus it is taken as obvious and indisputable that Russians all read, say, a novel by Pushkin in one and the same way, but that no one who reads an anglicized version of that novel could possibly get anything like âthat same experienceâ (as if the reading of that novel engendered just one experience in the vast world of all different Russian speakers). My retort would be that what matters is not the dried linguistic powder that is used to transport the dance between brains â what matters is the dance set up inside a brain by whatever dried powder is used for the transport. Linguists (I exempt those in the very recent cognitive-linguistics movement) concentrate so hard on the overt dried powder that they wind up largely ignoring the covert dances that engender it, and that it engenders. As an ironic consequence, the standard model of language that has been built up this century by linguists is hugely impoverished.\nMost peopleâs (and most linguistsâ) model of translation is as dry as the powder that carries dehydrated ideas from brain to brain; indeed, they conceive of translation as a mapping from one purely dehydrated chain of symbols to another dehydrated chain of symbols, without any need for âadding waterâ at any stage of the process. The whole process happens purely at the level of the dry symbols. Translation would thus be an activity for drones â and hence ideal for computers to carry out. Here â courtesy of my Sofia hotel â is an example of the âdroneâ theory of translation:\nPlease\ndonât\ndisturb\nâ\nâ\nâ\nBitte\nnicht\nstÃ¶ren\nOr, as the early machine-translation pioneer Warren Weaver once wrote (Weaver 1955), âWhen I look at an article in Russian, I say, âThis is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. I shall now proceed to decode.ââ\nSince translation is but the challenge of communication rendered crystal-clear, and since communication is but metaphor, and since metaphor is but analogy, I shall spend the rest of this article on analogy focusing on translation and showing how at its core translation is analogy, and indeed, is analogy at its most sublime and enchanting.\n[]()EvgeniÄ­ Onegin\nWhen, a few paragraphs back, I wrote the phrase âa novel by Pushkin,â my choice was not as flippant as I tried to make it seem. Indeed, as a recent translator of Alexander Pushkinâs novel in verseÂ Eugene Onegin,Â I have been totally absorbed over the past year or so in the delicious but daunting [[task]] of reincarnating Pushkinâs sparkling poetry in the medium of contemporary English â or rather, contemporary American. It has not, needless to say, been a process that looked anything like the Sofia-hotel model, with the two-headed vertical arrows connecting words. In order to give a sense of what was involved, I must first describe the building blocks of the novel, usually called âOnegin stanzas.â Each sonnet (of which there are nearly four hundred) is a âcrystalâ â a pattern to transplant from one medium to another. What is the nature of these crystals?\nTo begin with, each one consists of fourteen lines of strict iambic tetrameter (which means â at least in Russian â that stresses never fall on odd-numbered syllables). The rhyming pattern is always as follows:\nA B A B C C D D E F F E G G\nand within this framework, the âA,â âC,â and âEâ line-pairs have the special property of being feminine rhymes, while the âB,â âD,â âF,â and âGâ line-pairs are masculine. The distinction is as follows: âreturn/discernâ is a masculine rhyme, because the final syllables not only rhyme but are stressed, whereas âreturning/discerningâ is a feminine rhyme, because the penultimate syllables rhyme and are stressed, while the final syllables are not only unstressed but identical. In other words, in feminine rhymes, the ârhyming actionâ takes place before the lineâs final syllable (which is unstressed), whereas in masculine rhymes, the rhyming action takes place on the final syllable (which is stressed).\nAs a consequence of this intricate design, an Onegin stanzaâs lines have varying numbers of syllables, depending on whether they are feminine or masculine. The six âA,â âC,â and âEâ lines have nine syllables apiece, while all others have eight, as follows:\n9 8 9 8 9 9 8 8 9 8 8 9 8 8\nAll four hundred crystals in the original Russian have this property, and thus all four hundred crystals in the counterpart work in English should â should they not? â have this same property. The crucial question is, of course, what kind of compromises should be made in the transportation of Pushkinâs virtuoso game into the new medium. One type of translator (Nabokov 1964) might insist on retaining the most literal possible rendering of each word and even much of the Russian word order, in which case all rhyming and rhythmic properties would have to be sacrificed. This would seem rather akin to the word-for-word Sofia-hotel model, and quite uninspired as a translation philosophy.\nAnother type of translator would insist on retaining the medium-message marriage that well-wrought poetry inevitably is, and thus on looking behind the scenes, looking beyond the dry dust on the paper, looking at the sparkling mental dance to which the dry powder gives rise, once water is added to it. To such a translator, what matters is that each semantic chunk of the original poetry (whether contained within a single line or spread across several) gives rise to a scene in the mindâs eye of a reader (not to mention that of Pushkin), and this type of translator, having tried to envision that scene as clearly, fully, and. faithfully as possible, then uses it as a source for English words and phrases that can be used in lines of English poetry that obey. the formal constraints. Such a translator, in short, is inspired by the inner dance and not merely by the dry powder.\nSince the scene conjured up by a line or two of the original goes far beyond the literal words in those lines (i.e., since âjust adding waterâ adds such richness!), there is much more to draw on as potential material for a new poem in English, and so one is enormously freed up. There remain, of course, all the rhythmic and rhyming hoops to jump through, but by adding water, one has at least given oneself a fighting chance at finding a solution satisfying all the relevant constraints.\nOf course satisfying those constraints is not a simple [[task]], nor is it by any means a black-and-white matter to judge whether (or to what degree) the constraints have actually been met. There are many pressures vying with each other, and by no means are they all explicit, although some are. One might cite the following sets of pressures under which a translator must work:\nContent: the image evoked by the words and phrases in a semantic chunk\nStructural pattern: the above-described features that define the phonetic nature of an Onegin stanza\nTone: an intangible brew of subliminally felt qualities suggested by the following oppositions: humorous vs. serious; straightforward vs. ironic; heavy vs. light; old-fashioned vs. modern; meditative vs. peppy; sweet vs. sad; resigned vs. delighted; highbrow vs. lowbrow; etc.\nThe only one of these constraints that has a sharp, black-and-white feel to it is that of the structural pattern, since it is generally fairly objective whether two words rhyme or not, how many syllables are in a word, where stress should fall, and whether a given two-syllable chunk is an iamb or not (although, in truth, these matters are surprisingly often quite blurry â does âmidnightâ make a true feminine rhyme with âslid rightâ? is âfinallyâ bisyllabic or trisyllabic?).\nThe other constraints are anything but sharp, since the content of any lexical item is (as has been the thrust of this paper) determined by a host of prior analogies, and hence is tremendously blurry, and since tone is not only vague but also highly multidimensional, allowing for any conceivable combination of degree of irony, degree of modernity, degree of sadness, and so on, ad infinitum.\nGiven the complexity of this range of competing pressures, it is hardly surprising that there will occur, in the translation of nearly every single line, smaller or larger creative slippages, typified by, but by no means limited to, the following list:\nThe âperfectâ literal translation of a word is abandoned in favor of a slightly less perfect choice, because of (say) phonetic constraints\nA syntactic reversal, slightly unusual in English, is resorted to for (say) reasons of metric purity\nAn idea or image is shifted from one line to another because English grammar works that way\nAn alliterative pattern is dropped in one stanza but is introduced out of the blue in another, in order to replicate fairly accurately the overall density of alliteration in the original\nA modern-seeming word is used in a passage that has an older tone, or vice versa, because of (say) certain extra connotations that are gained thereby\nA word strongly evocative of something linked tightly to the target culture but not the original culture (e.g., âjiveâ) is used, even if the effect creates a very short-lived subliminal shift of venue from source to target culture\nA perfect rhyme is sacrificed for a near-rhyme, in order to gain an extra set of connotations or to conjure up a precise image that would otherwise not be attainable\nA word is used in a highly metaphorical manner, stretching it even beyond its normal degree of plasticity\nA metaphor is dropped or is replaced by a different metaphor, because the original metaphor makes no sense in the target culture\nA metaphor is introduced out of the blue, perhaps because it is implicit in a stock phrase or proverb that fits aptly and that also rhymes very strongly;\nEtc., etc., etc.\nThe amusing fact about the result of all these kinds of creative slippage is that what emerges can often be so powerfully evocative of the original that it seems â at least on some levels â perfectly plausible to refer to the English-language Onegin stanza thereby produced as being âby Alexander Pushkin,â and therefore to write those three words on the front cover and spine and title page of the book, perhaps even relegating the translatorâs name to nothing more than a line in fine print on the copyright page.\nWe shall now take a look at the results of all these kinds of slippages caused by multiple rival pressures in the minds of different translators with different philosophies of translation. I have selected one stanza, the 29th from chapter II, to illustrate what kinds of things can occur. (See also chapters 8, 9, and 13 of Hofstadter 1997.)\nFirst I display Pushkinâs original Russian and, next to it, a literal translation by Vladimir Nabokov; thereafter, in order, stanzas by the following translators (in the chronological order of publication of their translations): Babette Deutsch, Oliver Elton, Walter Arndt, Charles Johnston, James Falen, and Douglas Hofstadter.[]()\nÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´Ñ ÐÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð½ (1825)\nÐÐ¹ ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¾ Ð½ÑÐ°Ð²Ð¸Ð»Ð¸ÑÑ ÑÐ¾Ð¼Ð°Ð½Ñ;\nÐÐ½Ð¸ ÐµÐ¹ Ð·Ð°Ð¼ÐµÐ½ÑÐ»Ð¸ Ð²ÑÐµ;\nÐÐ½Ð° Ð²Ð»ÑÐ±Ð»ÑÐ»Ð°ÑÑ Ð² Ð¾Ð±Ð¼Ð°Ð½Ñ\nÐ Ð Ð¸ÑÐ°ÑÐ´ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð° Ð¸ Ð ÑÑÑÐ¾.\nÐÑÐµÑ ÐµÐµ Ð±ÑÐ» Ð´Ð¾Ð±ÑÑÐ¹ Ð¼Ð°Ð»ÑÐ¹,\nÐ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ´ÑÐµÐ¼ Ð²ÐµÐºÐµ Ð·Ð°Ð¿Ð¾Ð·Ð´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ¹;\nÐÐ¾ Ð² ÐºÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð°Ñ Ð½Ðµ Ð²Ð¸Ð´Ð°Ð» Ð²ÑÐµÐ´Ð°;\nÐÐ½, Ð½Ðµ ÑÐ¸ÑÐ°Ñ Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð´Ð°,\nÐÑ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð» Ð¿ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¹ Ð¸Ð³ÑÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¹\nÐ Ð½Ðµ Ð·Ð°Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ¸Ð»ÑÑ Ð¾ ÑÐ¾Ð¼,\nÐÐ°ÐºÐ¾Ð¹ Ñ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐºÐ¸ ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÑÐ¾Ð¼\nÐÑÐµÐ¼Ð°Ð» Ð´Ð¾ ÑÑÑÐ° Ð¿Ð¾Ð´ Ð¿Ð¾Ð´ÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¹.\nÐÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¶ ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð±ÑÐ»Ð° ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð°\nÐÑ Ð Ð¸ÑÐ°ÑÐ´ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð° Ð±ÐµÐ· ÑÐ¼Ð°.\nÂ \nVladimir Nabokov (1964)\nShe early had been fond of novels;\nfor her they replaced all;\nshe grew enamored with the fictions\nof Richardson and of Rousseau.\nHer father was a kindly fellow\nwho lagged in the precedent age\nbut saw no harm in reading books;\nhe, never reading,\ndeemed them an empty toy,\nnor did he care\nwhat secret tome his daughter had\ndozing till morn under her pillow.\nAs to his wife, she was herself\nmad upon Richardson.\nÂ \nBabette Deutsch (1936)\nShe found in a romantic story\nAll one might care to be or know;\nLiving the chapters through, sheâd glory\nIn Richardson as in Rousseau.\nHer father saw no harm in reading\n(He was a decent chap, conceding\nHe lived in quite another age);\nBut then he never read a page.\nHe did not know that books could say things\nTo move you even while you slept;\nHe thought the tomes his daughter kept\nBeneath her pillow, empty playthings;\nWhile, on the other hand, his wife\nHeld Richardson as dear as life.\nÂ \nOliver Elton (1937)\nRomances were her only passion,\nAnd all the world to her; and so\nShe fell in love, the dupe of fashion,\nWith Richardson, and with Rousseau.\nQuite a good fellow was her father,\nOf the last age, belated rather;\nHe saw no mischief in a book,\nThough in one he would never look;\nThought it a toy, and held it lightly,\nAnd cared not what his daughter did\nWhen she a private volume hid\nBeneath her pillow, slumbering nightly.\nHis lady wife was mad upon\nThe tales of Samuel Richardson.\nÂ \nWalter Arndt (1963)\nBut novels, which she early favored,\nReplaced for her all other treats;\nWith rapturous delight she savored\nRousseauâs and Richardsonâs conceits.\nHer honest father, though old-fashioned,\nLast centuryâs child, grew not impassioned\nAbout the harm that books might breed;\nHe, who was never known to read,\nRegarded them as empty thrillers\nAnd never thought to bring to light\nWhich secret volume dreamt at night\nBeneath his little daughterâs pillows.\nHis wife had had a crush herself\nOn Richardson â still on her shelf.\nÂ \nCharles Johnston (1977)\nFrom early on she loved romances,\nthey were her only food... and so\nshe fell in love with all the fancies\nof Richardson and of Rousseau.\nHer father, kindly, well-regarded,\nbut in an earlier age retarded,\ncould see no harm in books; himself\nhe never took one from the shelf,\nthought them a pointless peccadillo;\nand cared not what his daughter kept\nby way of secret tome that slept\nuntil the dawn beneath her pillow.\nHis wife, just like Tatyana, had\non Richardson gone raving mad.\nÂ \nJames Falen (1990)\nFrom early on she read romances,\nAnd novels set her heart aglow;\nShe loved the fictions and the fancies\nOf Richardson and of Rousseau.\nHer father was a kindly fellow\nLost in a past he found more mellow;\nBut still, in books he saw no harm,\nAnd, though immune to readingâs charm,\nDeemed it a minor peccadillo;\nNor did he care what secret tome\nHis daughter read or kept at home\nAsleep till morn beneath her pillow;\nHis wife herself, we ought to add,\nFor Richardson was simply mad.\nÂ \nDouglas Hofstadter (1999)\nFrom early on, she read romances;\nTrue life they were for her, not show.\nShe fell for all the moods and trances\nInduced by authors like Rousseau\nAnd Richardson. A friendly fellow,\nHer father was old-fashioned, mellow,\nAnd saw in books no cause for dread;\nInstead, because he never read,\nHe thought of them as dull and boring,\nAnd didnât give a tinkerâs damn\nWhat brand of frivolous flim-flam\nHis daughter clutched all night while snoring.\nBut on the other hand, his wife\nThought Richardson the spice of life.\nÂ \nEach of these compact fourteen-line verbal packets is a structure that bears to the original packet the relation of analog in the medium of the English language. Each one is clearly the result of myriad tradeoffs involving preservation of imagery, strictness of meter, perfection of rhyme, phonetic patternedness, era exuded by words and phrases, degree of humor, degree of catchiness, degree of familiarity of lexical items, ease of syntactical flow, sequential order of ideas, and much more.\nTake, for instance, the word âinsteadâ on line 8 of my translation. Initially, I had line 8 beginning with âindeed,â which in some ways is stronger (because âindeedâ carries a more emphatic flavor than âinstead,â and also because, more subtly, the comma-signaled pause that would follow âindeedâ strikes me as ever-so-slightly longer and more charged than its counterpart with âinsteadâ), and yet despite these lures, the internal rhyme of âinsteadâ with âdreadâ preceding it and with âreadâ following it somehow carried the day in my mind. This is typical of the multidimensional internal conflicts that occur routinely in translation, and each time, one has to weigh all the factors and make a decision.\nOn a more blatant semantic level, you may note that the imagery in my stanza is that of the daughter sleeping â nay, snoring! â while clinging tightly to a favorite book, whereas the imagery in the original is of the book itself sleeping (or dreaming) beneath the girlâs pillow. To what extent is one entitled to manipulate imagery this way and then to claim that the resulting book is âby Alexander Pushkinâ?\nTo what extent did the nonanglophone Russian poet Alexander Pushkin ever say, in describing the girlâs father, âand didnât give a tinkerâs damnâ? On the other hand, to what extent did Pushkin ever write the line ânor did he careâ? Using the former as line 10 provides a clear whiff of Pushkinesque humor (not to mention having the proper meter, rhyme, and so on), while using the latter as line 10 is bland and flat (and is but four syllables long, where Pushkinâs line had, of course, four full iambs on it).\nBy what right did I feel entitled to insert an alliterative and flippant phrase like âfrivolous flim-flamâ into the lyrical mouth of Alexander Pushkin? On the other hand, by what right did Vladimir Nabokov feel entitled to insert the graceless and nonidiomatic phrase, âAs to his wife, she was herself mad upon Richardsonâ into the mouth of Russiaâs greatest poet? For that matter, by what right did James Falen think he could get away with a pseudorhyme like âromancesâ and âfanciesâ? As for Walter Arndt, by what right did think he could get away with a nonrhyme like âthrillersâ and âpillowsâ? And by what right did Charles Johnston think he was entitled to portray the girlâs novels as âher only foodâ? By what right did Babette Deutsch rearrange the order of Pushkinâs ideas, so as to make the fatherâs old-fashionedness follow (and in parentheses, to boot!) his seeing no harm in books? And how in the world did Oliver Elton feel he was being faithful to Pushkin by using the bizarrely redundant phrase âhis lady wifeâ?\nOf course I am feigning outrage here; I have great respect for most of these translators, despite the fact that I see compromises ubiquitously riddling the productions of each of them. The questions just raised were raised purely rhetorically, my intention being to provoke readers into pondering which of these seven rival English-language stanzas might be seen as the most analogous to Pushkinâs original stanza (without claiming there is any âcorrectâ answer).\nWinding Up: On Associationism and the Cartesian Theater\nWe have come a long way, starting out by seeing single words as analogs to perceived situations, and ending up by seeing sonnets in different languages as each otherâs analogs. Somewhere near the midpoint came the crux of this essay, however, which claimed that thinking (at least when isolated from external influences) is a series of leaps involving high-level perception, activation of concepts in long-term memory, transfer to short-term memory, partial and context-dependent unpacking of chunks, and then further high-level perception, and so forth.\nThis may sound like no more than the age-old idea of associationism â that we think by jumping associatively from one thing to another. If thatâs all it came down to, my thesis would certainly be a sterile and vapid noncontribution to cognitive science. But the mechanisms I posit are more specific, and in particular they depend on the transfer of tightly packed mental chunks from the dormant area of long-term memory into the active area of short-term memory, and on their being unpacked on arrival, and then scrutinized. Both transfer and perception are crucial, and in that respect, my thesis departs significantly from associationism.\nSome readers, such as the author ofÂ Consciousness explainedÂ (Dennett 1991), might feel they detect in this theory of thinking an insidious residue of the so-called Cartesian theater â a hypothetical theater in which an âinner eyeâ watches as various images go parading by on a âmental screen,â and becomes âawareâ or âconsciousâ of such imagery. Such a notion of thinking leads very easily down the slippery slope of nested homunculi, and thus to an infinite regress concerning the site of consciousness.\n. I would gladly plead guilty to the accusation of positing a âscreenâ upon which are âprojectedâ certain representations dredged up from long-term memory, and I would also plead guilty to the accusation of positing an âinner eyeâ that scans that screen and upon it posts further representational structures, which trigger a descent via analogy into the dormant depths of long-term memory. I would insist, however, that the label âperception,â as applied to what the âinner eyeâ does, be sharply distinguished from visual or any other kind of sensory perception, since in general it involves no sensory modality in any normal sense of the term (recall the perception of âethnic cleansingâ in a newspaper story). The nature of such abstract or high-level perceptual processing has been sketched out in work done by my students and myself over the years (see Hofstadter and FARG 1995), and I will not attempt to describe it here.\nClearly, since it has been implemented as a computer program (at least to a first approximation), such a model does not succumb to snagging on the fatal hook of infinite regress.\nTo those who would scoff at the very notion of any âinner screenâ involved in cognition, I would point to the large body of work of perceptual psychologist Anne Treisman (e.g., Treisman 1988), which in my view establishes beyond any doubt the existence of temporary perceptual structures created on the fly in working memory (she cal\\s them âobject filesâ) â a stark contrast to the connectionist-style thesis that all cognition takes place in long-term memory, and that it consists merely of simultaneous conceptual activations (possibly with attached temporal phases, so as to handle the âbinding problemâ) without any type of transfer to, or structure-building in, a distinct working area. Although this more distributed view of the essence of cognition might appeal to opponents of the Cartesian theater, it does not seem to .me that it comes anywhere close to allowing the richness of thought that back-and-forth flow between long-term and short-term memory would allow.\nI hope that my speculative portrayal of analogy as the lifeblood, so to speak, of human thinking, despite being highly ambitious and perhaps somewhat overreaching, strikes a resonant chord in those who study cognition. My most optimistic vision would be that the whole field of cognitive science suddenly woke up to the centrality of analogy, that all sides suddenly saw eye to eye on topics that had formerly divided them most bitterly, and naturally â indeed, it goes without saying â that they lived happily ever after.

But the models themselves now began to grow unmanageably complex.

Augmenting man's intellect, in the sense defined above, would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society if there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible benefits.\ndeveloping means to augment the human intellect. These \"means\" can include many thingsâall of which appear to be but extensions of means developed and used in the past to help man apply his native sensory, mental, and motor capabilitiesâand we consider the whole system of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.[1a3](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a3)\nThis kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiveness does not find a ready-made conceptual framework such as exists for established disciplines. Before a research program can be designed to pursue such an approach intelligently, so that practical benefits might be derived within a reasonable time while also producing results of longrange significance, a conceptual framework must be searched outâa framework that provides orientation as to the important factors of the system, the relationships among these factors, the types of change among the system factors that offer likely improvements in performance, and the sort of research goals and methodology that seem promising. [1a4](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a4)\nIn the first (search) phase of our program we have developed a conceptual framework that seems satisfactory for the current needs of designing a research phase.Â [Section II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II)Â contains the essence of this framework as derived from several different ways of looking at the system made up of a human and his intellect-augmentation means.**[1a5](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a5)**\nThe process of developing this conceptual framework brought out a number of significant realizations: that the intellectual effectiveness exercised today by a given human has little likelihood of being intelligence limitedâthat there are dozens of disciplines in engineering, mathematics, and the social, life, and physical sciences that can contribute improvements to the system of intellect-augmentation means; that any one such improvement can be expected to trigger a chain of coordinating improvements; that until every one of these disciplines comes to a standstill and we have exhausted all the improvement possibilities we could glean from it, we can expect to continue to develop improvements in this human-intellect system; that there is no particular reason not to expect gains in personal intellectual effectiveness from a concerted system-oriented approach that compare to those made in personal geographic mobility since horseback and sailboat days.**[1a6](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a6)**\n[]()\n[]()The picture of how one can view the possibilities for a systematic approach to increasing human intellectual effectiveness, as put forth inÂ [Section II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II)Â in the sober and general terms of an initial basic analysis, does not seem to convey all of the richness and promise that was stimulated by the development of that picture. Consequently,Â [Section III](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#III)Â is intended to present some definite images that illustrate meaningful possibilities deriveable from the conceptual framework presented inÂ [Section II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II)âand in a rather marked deviation from ordinary technical writing, a good portion ofÂ [Section III](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#III)Â presents these images in a fiction-dialogue style as a mechanism for transmitting a feeling for the richness and promise of the possibilities in one region of the improvement space\" that is roughly mapped inÂ [Section II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II).**[1a7](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a7)**\n[]()\n[]()The style ofÂ [Section III](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#III)Â seems to make for easier reading. IfÂ [Section II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II)Â begins to seem unrewardingly difficult, the reader may find it helpful to skip fromÂ [Section II-B](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#2b)Â directly toÂ [Section III](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#III). If it serves its purpose well enough,Â [Section III](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#III)Â will provide a context within which the reader can go back and finishÂ [Section II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II)Â with less effort.**[1a8](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a8)**\n[]()\n[]()InÂ [Section IV](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#IV)Â (Research Recommendations) we present a general strategy for pursuing research toward increasing human intellectual effectiveness. This strategy evolved directly from the [[concepts]] presented in SectionsÂ [II](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#II)Â andÂ [III](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#III); one of its important precepts is to pursue the quickest gains first, and use the increased intellectual effectiveness thus derived to help pursue successive gains. We see the quickest gains emerging from (1) giving the human the minute-by-minute services of a digital computer equipped with computer-driven cathode-ray-tube display, and (2) developing the new methods of thinking and working that allow the human to capitalize upon the computer's help. By this same strategy, we recommend that an initial research effort develop a prototype system of this sort aimed at increasing human effectiveness in the task of computer programming.**[1a9](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a9)**\n[]()\n[]()To give the reader an initial orientation about what sort of thing this computer-aided working system might be, we include below a short description of a possible system of this sort. This illustrative example is not to be considered a description of the actual system that will emerge from the program. It is given only to show the general direction of the work, and is clothed in fiction only to make it easier to visualize.**[1a10](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a10)**\n[]()\n[]()Let us consider an augmented architect at work. He sits at a working station that has a visual display screen some three feet on a side; this is his working surface, and is controlled by a computer (his \"clerk\") with which he can communicate by means of a small keyboard and various other devices.**[1a11](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a11)**\nHe is designing a building. He has already dreamed up several basic layouts and structural forms, and is trying them out on the screen. The surveying data for the layout he is working on now have already been entered, and he has just coaxed the clerk to show him a perspective view of the steep hillside building site with the roadway above, symbolic representations of the various trees that are to remain on the lot, and the service tie points for the different utilities. The view occupies the left two-thirds of the screen. With a \"pointer,\" he indicates two points of interest, moves his left hand rapidly over the keyboard, and the distance and elevation between the points indicated appear on the right-hand third of the screen.**[1a12](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a12)**\nNow he enters a reference line with his pointer, and the keyboard. Gradually the screen begins to show the work he is doingâa neat excavation appears in the hillside) revises itself slightly, and revises itself again. After a moment, the architect changes the scene on the screen to an overhead plan view of the site, still showing the excavation. A few minutes of study, and he enters on the keyboard a list of items, checking each one as it appears on the screen, to be studied later.**[1a13](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a13)**\nIgnoring the representation on the display, the architect next begins to enter a series of specifications and dataâa six-inch slab floor, twelve-inch concrete walls eight feet high within the excavation, and so on. When he has finished, the revised scene appears on the screen. A structure is taking shape. He examines it, adjusts it, pauses long enough to ask for handbook or catalog information from the clerk at various points, and readjusts accordingly. He often recalls from the \"clerk\" his working lists of specifications and considerations to refer to them, modify them, or add to them. These lists grow into an evermore-detailed, interlinked structure, which represents the maturing thought behind the actual design.**[1a14](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a14)**\nPrescribing different planes here and there, curved surfaces occasionally, and moving the whole structure about five feet, he finally has the rough external form of the building balanced nicely with the setting and he is assured that this form is basically compatible with the materials to be used as well as with the function of the building.**[1a15](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a15)**\nNow he begins to enter detailed information about the interior. Here the capability of the clerk to show him any view he wants to examine (a slice of the interior, or how the structure would look from the roadway above) is important. He enters particular fixture designs, and examines them in a particular room. He checks to make sure that sun glare from the windows will not blind a driver on the roadway, and the \"clerk\" computes the information that one window will reflect strongly onto the roadway between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings.**[1a16](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a16)**\nNext he begins a functional analysis. He has a list of the people who will occupy this building, and the daily sequences of their activities. The \"clerk\" allows him to follow each in turn, examining how doors swing, where special lighting might be needed. Finally he has the \"clerk\" combine all of these sequences of activity to indicate spots where traffic is heavy in the building, or where congestion might occur, and to determine what the severest drain on the utilities is likely to be.**[1a17](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a17)**\nAll of this information (the building design and its associated \"thought structure\") can be stored on a tape to represent the design manual for the building. Loading this tape into his own clerk, another architect, a builder, or the client can maneuver within this design manual to pursue whatever details or insights are of interest to himâand can append special notes that are integrated into the design manual for his own or someone else's later benefit.**[1a18](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a18)**\nIn such a future working relationship between human problem-solver and computer 'clerk,' the capability of the computer for executing mathematical processes would be used whenever it was needed. However, the computer has many other capabilities for manipulating and displaying information that can be of significant benefit to the human in nonmathematical processes of planning, organizing, studying, etc. Every person who does his thinking with symbolized [[concepts]] (whether in the form of the English language, pictographs, formal logic, or mathematics) should be able to benefit significantly.\nMorning\nRe-read this\nhttp://ahistoryofthefuture.org/ankle-surveillance-monitors/\nhttp://ahistoryofthefuture.org/the-guide/\n18:31 -- 19:19\nTotally changed my position on [[How can we develop transformative tools for thought?]]\nI still wish the essay didn't lead with such a long example of memory tools, because the juice is at the end, and I'm worried the idea won't actually spread effectively because the memory example is confusing\nesp for the type of people who think that the Tools for Thought world is done -- that it reached its apex with Evernote and Google Docs\nI struggled for a while to convince anyone working on x-risk that tools for thought were worth pursuing, the best points of the essay were with why the field matters, and why it's ridiculous to think that [[Google Docs]] and [[Evernote]] are the end all\nffs [[Tiago Forte]]\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181636283598163968'\nRealizing it is not a totally crazy idea to put some of my public thoughts in here, rather than in my private db, since it gives at least a taste of how the transient notes that you take just to get thoughts out of your head can end up connecting into the more re-usable blocks that help you shape an idea\nAlso nice to publicly document how my thoughts on a topic are changing over time\nFounder of:: Longevity Research Institute\nhttps://thelri.org/\nauthor:: [[How to Make a Memex]]\nblog::\nhttps://srconstantin.posthaven.com/\ntwitter::\nhttps://twitter.com/s_r_constantin\nsource:: https://srconstantin.posthaven.com/how-to-make-a-memex\nDemo of Roam\nQuestions::\nWhat are the types of things I'll want to do in Roam?\nTake some notes\nDoesn't matter where\nTo create a new page you can click the + button\n we don't like that though -  as those pages are now disconnected\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FyTjlflMTFv?alt=media&token=b5e98794-cf13-400f-a022-9e96d1a062d0)\nBetter to start in the daily notes, and often to take the notes there, just nested underneath the topic you're writing about, which might be a page\nSo\n[[Bio Class]]\nTeacher said this\nWhen you don't know where to put it, just put it on the thing for the day\nWhen you have an idea, that you think you'll want to refer back to... like this guy was talking about \n ((OPIfReBKQ))\nThen you sometimes are going to want to make a page for that idea \nHow do I make a word into a page?\nYou write it inside `[[`Inside this thing `]]`  \nyou can also highlight a word, and then hit `[[`\nif you forget this, you can also hit the / command, and choose `link` \nHow do you make things have a special font?\nSo, let's say I make a database of quotes and stuff in Roam, how do I use it for actually writing and formatting a paper\nProbably want to look at [[Writing Tips in Roam]]\nSo let's say I'm ready to right a paper about epidemiology of malaria and I'm ready to start writing a doc, how do I move things around without pulling them out of their context\n[[Block Mentions]]\nExample\n[[Cognition]]\n[[My paper on Cognition]]\nNote:: The best part of the demo, was creating a new page with a common word, and showing how it pulled in a lot of quotes and then we could find something interesting\nBig Idea one\nQuotes\nmy phrasing of he label used for them.

We're grateful to have you on board ð\n__Tip: if you're not sure how to add tags or use filters, check out our help page here.__\nRoam for [[Conflict resolution]]\nHalf the problem in resolving conflict is figuring out the crux of the actual disagreement.\nOne way to explore this is to make a note of any personal or professional conflicts in your daily log, tag the topic and context, and any steps you intend to take.\nThen you can [[DO SCIENCE]] by looking through your log for recurring patterns:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FLh9F62Y28K?alt=media&token=6854ca89-3d90-4d65-a31f-5c8f937eb6b9)\nWhich might generate some insights:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FdRoAFJt5CZ?alt=media&token=5ae4612c-ef77-4409-9fe8-31f60746be3d)\nYou can also prompt yourself with suggestions based on previous lessons learned:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FtrcfpZa4fe?alt=media&token=9bc211df-577c-4b0e-83d3-1ca3f3ae6285)\n__Tip: if you're not sure how to use filters, check out our help guide here.__\nRoam for [[GTD]]\n[[Roam for GTD]]\nHas already been done, and is too in-depth for our purposes here - better to do something like 'Roam for time management', and link to the GTD guide from there.\nRoam for [[Reading list]]\nSo many books, so little time!\nThere is no solution to the bibliophile's dilemma, but here's how Roam can ease the burden.\nWhenever someone gives you a reading recommendation, create a new page for it, and add some metadata:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2F5-RwBB_3K6?alt=media&token=717d1034-8be1-485a-b098-239ec8afb072)\nNow when you visit your [[Books]] page, you can filter your list on any of these attributes.\nFor example, you might only want to see all the #science or #design books recommended by a trusted curator, while screening out those you've already read:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FjIC8uq6hkk?alt=media&token=44141e8b-e076-405f-8367-df22739aa539)\n__Tip: We've used soft linebreaks (Shift + Enter) so we can see all the metadata at a glance, but you could also nest the data in bullets under a__ #Books __or__ \n#[[Reading list]]__ tag.__\nAnd of course, each page you reference will also point back to the books and texts associated with them.\nSome inspiration for other potential connections:\nBottlenecks or precursors to reading this book\nHarder reading material this text 'unlocks'\nCurrent or future projects this might be useful for\nA slider for weighting importance, and updating on new info\nOne of life's great tragedies is that there are far more interesting books and papers than we can possibly hope to read in the candle-flicker of a single lifetime.\nBut at least we can do a lot better than the usual scattershot approach!\n**TODO**\nRoam for [[Time Management]]\nTrying to keep track of a bunch of open loops and to-dos can be overwhelming.\nRoam makes it easy to get them out of your head, and organised into atomic tasks.\nYou can jot down tasks and stray thoughts in relevant project pages, or dump then in your Daily Notes.\nOnce they're broken down into concrete actions, you can use tags like #urgent or #[[this week]] to sort and prioritize them.\nYou can also use the Datepicker tool to assign a reminder or a deadline, which generates a backlink on the relevant day:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FzW_410boDP?alt=media&token=7bd174a9-cf94-4b02-af01-5a8caff103a4)\n__Tip: You can convert multiple blocks into to-dos at once. Select them all, and then right-click on the highlighted area.__\nYou can use the Current Time feature to timestamp each activity through the course of a day, and get a better sense of you're spending your time:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FdyUGO5ObJP?alt=media&token=65e9ffd9-b2fb-4ef9-95bd-b220ee150e8d)\n__Tip: The Date Picker and Current Time stamp are in the slash command menu for rapid access.__\nFor a more detailed breakdown of a personal productivity system in action, you can also check out our guide to Roam for [[GTD]].\nRoam for book notes\nX was unusually good but I feel like I need to process it more. I'm going to import my Kindle highlights and break them down into subcategories.\nHuh, this claim clashes with what X said. How to reconcile? Time to [[DO SCIENCE]]!\nOK, now I've updated, I'll add a slider to express my confidence: {{[[slider]]}}\nThat reminds me a lot of this concept from Y. I'm going to add a reference here.\nExample gifs:\nI've added plenty of book notes so can pull out some that fit the format above.\nRoam for logging workouts\nTime to get shredded. Let's see, what did I train last time? I'll take a look at my training log...\nAlright, I want to do dips on the rings, and L-sits from parallettes. I can filter my log to see my previous personal bests for each of those variants.\nNow I'm gonna make a new training log entry in my daily notes, and plug in my sets, reps and volume.\nI'm also gonna take note of the fact that my knee is still feeling a bit dodgy, and create a todo to make a physio appointment.\nExample gifs:\nI do this already so can easily record an example, e.g. quick screencap:\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2F80QLJFsLr1?alt=media&token=a0c8e163-ea88-49d4-82d7-aae06969244b)\nRoam for [[Morning Pages]]\n__Meta: it might be better if you do this one since I've never actually done this before and not super familiar with how it works.__\n__Here's a variant I could do, not exactly morning pages but more of a riff on time management.__\nOK, wake up in the morning. First thing I want to do is empty my monkey brain, I notice I feel a little anxious so gonna do some freeform journaling, link to any concept or person that comes up.\nCool, now I have more clarity. I'm going to check my todos, the reminders in my mentions of this log day, and make a list of tasks to accomplish.\nAlright, I'm set! Gonna use the Current Time picker to do some time-tracking of each task too.\nExample gifs:\nI can use some real examples from my database.\nRoam for self-experimentation\n__Meta: I think__ [[Quantified Self]] __has huge potential but it is a bit underpowered in Roam until we get automated addition/averaging and graphs working. I'm struggling to think of an example that isn't too reliant on manual number-crunching, will have another go tomorrow.__\nI want to try a few different melatonin dosages and then track my sleep quality over time.\nFirst I'm gonna design the experiment on the melatonin page, and pin it to the sidebar.\nNow it's time to [[DO SCIENCE]]!\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2Fw-mz1n4yBW?alt=media&token=b0f85825-a3fd-46af-8dac-c20cfcbb0ee4)\n__Meta: are these janky tables gonna get axed at some point? If so I guess it might not be a good idea to use them in a demo (although can always link to whatever replaces them).__\nProbably best to replace this with [[Attributes in Roam]]\nRoam for [[Relationship Management]]\n__Meta: is there a special name for a system like this? I can't remember what it's called. As someone with a terrible memory I honestly feel like this is a minor superpower: yeah, course I remember the names of your kids!__\nOK, I see I've got a call with Sonnie today. First thing I'm gonna do is visit his page and revisit the precis of what we talked about on the last couple calls.\nOh yeah, he was going to submit his grant proposal last month - let's make a note to follow up on that. I also need to give him an update on the situation with the group house.\nAfter the call: OK, that was fire - I'm going to upload the whole Otter transcript and tag it with the relevant topic areas.\nAlso gonna make a couple todos for the book he recommended and a potential contact he said I should reach out to.\nExample gifs:\nHave to stage this a bit so as to not actually share personal info but happy to do so from my database.\nRoam for [[Zettelkasten]]\nIs too in-depth for our purposes here - better to do something like 'Roam for book notes', and link to the Zettelkasten guide from there.\nRoam for collaborative research\n__Meta: getting tired and tapping out here, will resume tomorrow__\nRules for Roam\nEverything I write goes into the daily notes\nWhen I want to reference an external source, I create a page for the article\n[[The Refragmentation]]\nI then am going to create a meta-data line, and nest all of the content of the article under the line\nsee ((AK-NZsl-H))\nWhen I want to comment on something, I'm going to nest my comments on the thing I'm reading underneath a tag for the page\n[[The Refragmentation]] \none of [[kash]]'s favorite essays\n((XXq5YE2rj)) \nthis is an important idea\ncertainty:: {{[[slider]]}}\nQuestions::\n{{[[DONE]]}} How do I incorporate this work into my [[Master's Thesis]]?\nInstead of just making a tag/link for the piece I'm reading, I'm also going to make a link/tag for the project that it relates to\n[[The Refragmentation]] [[Master's Thesis]]\nPaul Graham points out that the real problem in [[America]] started with a change in [[Corporations]]\nsee ((XXq5YE2rj))\nI can also do this retroactively -- so for instance, when I want to focus down on Chapter 1 of my thesis, I might go back and amend that link to saying Chapter one\nor just do this\n[[[[Master's Thesis]]/Chapter 1]]\nIntroduction\nblah blah blah\nbhalhhljakljdf ahladf \nlkasdfjlkjadsfj\nalkjdflkasdflkjasdfj \nljasdflaksdjflksajdf \n[[December 4th, 2019]]\n{{embed: ((7aoCWRXP2))}}\n{{[[DONE]]}} Should I have multiple databases or one \nI strongly recommend having only a single database -- unless you a sharing with other people and want them to have full access to a large number of interconnected thoughts\nreason::\nI really like doing a thing called \"Morning pages\"\nExample::\n[[Morning Pages]] \n{{word-count}}\nthis is my journal for the day\nas I write in it, in a free association style, I may think of some random thoughts that relate to [[The Refragmentation]] or [[the Depression]] or [[Master's Thesis]], I can always filter out those morning pages notes when I am looking for only serious well written stuff, but sometimes I might jot down an interesting idea or phrase, and will want to encounter it again in the future.\nYou never know what is going to prompt you to have an idea that relates to an important project (or on the flip side, some emotional insight that relates to personal matters), and having the friction of switching databases may be enough to cause you to not capture it\nor at least, even if you capture it, you'll be losing the context of where the idea came from. \nstatus:: [[Experimental]]\nWarning: This feature is in alpha, hasn't been fully developed yet.  This is mostly for experimentation\nBlocks and Pages in Roam can both have attributes\nattributes are formed by wring `::` at the front of a block\nsee ((Vi3ndDjkT))\nThe structure of an attribute is `Entity Attribute Value`\nWhen an attribute is at the first level of indentation of a page, it is attached to the page itself\nsee ((9L7RTV9iB))\nWhen the block which an attribute is attached to only contains references to other blocks or pages, (or commas or the word and) the attribute is attached to those referenced entities instead\nExample\n[[Conor]] and [[Josh]]\nfounder of:: [[Roam]]\nProgramming Languages:: [[Clojure]] [[Javascript]]  \nThis setup will create 6 EAV relationships\nConor - founder of - Roam\nJosh -  founder of - Roam\nConor - Programming Languages - Clojure \nConor - Programming Languages - Javascript\nJosh  - Programming Languages - Clojure\nJosh - Programming Languages - Javascript\nWhen the block that an attribute is defined on contains only a string, then the value of the string is assigned as the value of the attribute\nExamples\n[[Conor]]\nfounder of:: [[Localocracy]]\nage:: 32\n[[Josh]]\nage:: 22\nThese attributes will eventually have a lot more power in Roam, for now, the only thing they are used for is to generate tables\nand charts in the limited case of attributes with numerical values that are excuslively placed on Daily Note pages \nAttribute tables are written as \n`{{attr-table:` `[[``Link to attribute``]]``}}` \nExample\n{{attr-table: [[status]]}}\nAttribute tables are \"greedy\" -- and try to pull in all related attributes that could be relevant to the table\nSteps\nThey look at the page listed to see if and where  it has been used as an attribute\nthey will look for all of the entities which have the attribute assigned\nthey will then find all of the other attributes which have been associated with those entities, and chart the values of each of those subsequent attributes\nExample\nAttribute Table for Age  \n{{attr-table: [[age]]}} \nIncludes more info than just age\nAttribute Table for Programming Languages {{attr-table: [[Programming Languages]]}}\nincludes more info than just programming languages\nClicking on the cell of each table will bring you to the place where the attribute was defined\nThe attributes do not need to be all defined in one place to be collected into the table\nFor example, if you click on [[San Francisco]] in either of the above tables, you'll see that the **lives in** relationship was defined on the [[Conor]] page, not near where other attributes were defined. \nAttributes can themselves be annotated using an [[Associative Data Model]]\n17:17\nWorking on a new [[Onboarding Flow]] to replace [[Welcome to Roam]]\nstructure will be sort of like a slide deck or wizard that new users step through, to introduce them to the core ideas, and then step by step teach them the core features they need\ncontent\nIntroduction\nRoam

https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202387496832618496\nAlright one week in, I've settled into some steady habits using roam, so there's a habit attractor here. Progress has slowed to more day-to-day but it still feels like winning the war on entropy as opposed to losing it in scrivener, email, or twitter.\n\n\nGonna start documenting subtle features here. First up: Roam is probably the most efficient prosthetic memory Iâve used, as in, creating efficient recall of thoughts Iâve already thunk and written up. A killer feature when youâve written as much as I have (good or bad).\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, ranking media Iâve used\n\nPaper: 1 (no recall aids unless you create ToCs or indices yourself)\n\nEmail newsletters: 2 (weak searchability, weak theme/thread continuity, weak gestalt, though substack is better than mailchimp)\n\nTwitter: 4 (strong searchability, strong threadability, weak gestalt)\n\nWiki: 5 (strong searchability, medium threadability, strong gestalt)\n\nBlog: 6 (strong searchability, strong threadability, strong gestalt)\n\nRoam: 8 (all of the above plus low friction update/create/rename)\n\n\nThe thing is, recall is a virtuous cycle. The better a medium supports recall, the easier it is to attach new information in the right places. Which makes recall even easier. And the easier it is to add content, the faster this process snowballs. So a [[compound interest]] effect.\n\nKnowledge generally depreciates, and a holy grail of knowledge modeling and capture for a long time has been to reverse the default negative interest rate it accrues and turn it positive. There was a â[[knowledge banking]]â project at Xerox back in the day that aimed at this for eg.\n\n\nIn the past most such efforts have failed because they relied on automation to try and keep entropy at bay, which sort of works weakly with relative legible and structured information. But for more squishy information, the only thing that works is a â[[many eyeballs]]â process.\n\n\nAnytime Iâve seen a positive-interest-rate knowledge repo, itâs because many people were resurfacing bits and pieces at random and making point improvements. So the only known solution to date for positive interest rate has been to collectivize and socialize the prosthetic memory #[[many eyeballs]]\n\nSo a good measure of the technical sophistication of a medium is to measure the number of people (eyeballs) and money (how much theyâre paid) required to sustain a positive interest rate. I think Roam reduces both to the limit: 1 person and self-funded hobby time. #[[many eyeballs]]\n\nCompare for instance Wikipedia (~100s-1000s unpaid) or Stanford Encyclopedia or Wolfram Mathworld (single digits -100s, but paid, directly it indirectly).\n\nThis is probably because Roam allows one mind to effectively act as many ([[Fox]] > [[Hedgehog]])\n\nIn practice, Iâm finding now that when I have a new nugget to add, from whatever headspace Iâm in (working, at the gym, random thought during in a meeting, half-asleep thought in bed), I can always make a quick judgment  of approximately where a thought belongs, and put it there. #[[What Not Where]]\n\nBy contrast in weaker media, I have to be in high energy, direct focus headspace, having warmed up around 30 minutes to get situation awareness around the whole project. Only then can I reliably lower entropy and turn interest rate positive. Roam lowers threshold to 10% of that.\n\nThis btw is the maker time/manager time problem pg wrote about. Making needs 4 hour chunks because anything less tends to increase entropy rather than decrease it in any non-trivial knowledge work project. So anything that lowers that lower limit is a big win. #[[Maker Schedule]]\nsee also ((69DXoiQ8d))\nMy suspicion is, a good KPI for a knowledge tool is minimum threshold of time required to make a negentropic update to it, with every halving of the threshold increasing its capacity to hold positive-interest-rate knowledge repos by an order of magnitude.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\n\nSo a tool with a 2h minimum can sustain a 10x bigger positive-rate knowledge base with the same budget of people/money than a 4h minimum. I suspect for Roam, a very suitable project may get it down to minutes, and for a typical project, maybe 30min.\n\nSomething like that.\n10:44 AM Â· Dec 8, 2019Â·Twitter for iPad\n16\n Likes\nRoam has a basic calculator component\nExample\n`{{calc: 1` `+ 1}}`= {{calc: 1 + 1}}\nThe calculator can pull block-references\nIt just strips the text to find numbers and ((1kEhvYrnP))\nequation symbols\n+\n- \n/ = division\n* = multiplication\n** = raise to the power of\n10 ** 2 = {{calc: 10**2}}\nExample -- change the value of ((MSl_pGiSi)) or ((H9rb4ssZm)) and you will see ((zZot1wT81)) update\nA: 1\nB: 2\n{{calc: ((MSl_pGiSi)) + ((H9rb4ssZm))}}\nThis can work recursively \nA * B * (A + B) = {{calc: ((MSl_pGiSi)) * ((H9rb4ssZm)) * ( ((zZot1wT81)) )}}\nIt can be hard to see how the equation works when most of the thing referenced are blocks\nYou can use control-c control-p to get a preview of the block you're looking at\nYou can also use Control-Shift-O to open a bullet point reference under your cursor in the sidebar -- which is useful for opening up the sources of variables  used in your calculation\nNote\nThe calculator using the javascript math engine \n{{embed: ((1kEhvYrnP))}}\nand currently numbers are rounded to nearest int on display\n2**3 = {{calc: 2**3}}\n1.2**8 = {{calc: 1.2**8}}\nExample::\n[[Simple Financial Model]]\nCustomers:: 700\nWeekly Customer Growth:: 1.15\nPrice per Customer:: 15\n{{table}}\n**Weeks from Now**\n**Total Customers**\n**Monthly Recurring Revenue**\n**ARR**\n4\n{{calc: ((13bkU2J4M)) * ((ar8KTTCQs))**((0tI85foPL)) }}\n${{calc: ((SX868MI-C)) * ((PCBUGgc7d))}}\n${{calc: ((HqMKtcha9)) *12}}\n12\n{{calc: ((13bkU2J4M)) * ((ar8KTTCQs))**((GPgFWnXTt))}}\n${{calc: ((rd70VP-Ry))  * ((PCBUGgc7d))}}\n${{calc: ((MZ1mCzpml)) * 12 }}\n15:45 -- 16:20 \n[[Reading]] articles recommended by [[Weiwei Hsu]]\n[[The Independent Researcher]]\n((wduiRwjZV))\nrelates to a bunch of recent ideas from [[Tyler Cowen]] accessible through the thread of threads pinned tweet in [[Conaw]]\nhttps://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1198399750032232449\nThread was actually from [[Meaningness]] and [[tylercowen]]\nhttps://twitter.com/Meaningness/status/1196480884494331904\nparticularly this tweet referencing [[vgr]] https://twitter.com/Meaningness/status/1196487838260326400\n[[Technical Conversations]]\nThese quotes vvv\n((R3d5KYzRM))\n((zDA_YT6tc))\ngenerated these notes for the [[Slip Box]]\n[[Technical People are just people who try to understand]]\n[[Questions are a sign you're paying attention]]\n((O8kt9_8X6))\nrelates to twitter thread on [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam for Zettlekasting]]\nwasn't actually in there\nwas here instead\nhttps://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1099185914666840069\nLinked the tweets together so I could find it faster next time, and for future readers https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1204191599665659904\n17:51\nhttp://weiweihsu.com/collection/\nsource:: https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research\n[[Nadia Eghbal]][[Quotes]][[Research]][[Essay]]\nJune 27, 2018\n[Adarsh Pandit](https://twitter.com/adarshp)Â recently introduced me to the concept of the âgentleman scientistâ: a researcher who funds their work independently. After digging around a bit, I was fascinated to learn that independent researchers were fairly common in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nMany researchers were personally wealthy or had access to deep pockets. ^^Charles Darwin pursued scientific collection as a hobby, and his first voyage onÂ [HMSÂ Beagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Survey_voyage_on_HMS_Beagle)Â was funded by his family^^. James Prescott Joule, after whom the joule is named, was âscientifically self-taughtâ,Â [doing research in his off-hours at the family brewery](https://books.google.com/books?id=i0XbtpXmcUsC&lpg=PA144&ots=bf4yeXsp0f&d&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q&f=false). And in the 1930s, Alfred Lee Loomis used his Wall Street wealth to start a laboratoryÂ [in his mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lee_Loomis#Laboratory_at_Tuxedo_Park), nicknamed âThe Palace of Scienceâ, where physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Enrico Fermi collaborated.\nThese days, if you say you work in research, most people assume you work in academia. But itâs sort of odd that we assume you need someoneâs permission to do research. Thereâs no reason that universities need to be the gatekeepers of exploring and developing new ideas.\nSometimes, a lack of training can produce even more interesting results. I was reminded of this recently after hearing a talk byÂ [Charles Mann](https://twitter.com/CharlesCMann), author ofÂ [The Wizard and the Prophet](https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Prophet-Remarkable-Scientists-Tomorrows/dp/0307961699). He told the story of Norman Borlaug, an agronomist who developed disease-resistant wheat varieties that are estimated to have prevented over half a billion deaths worldwide. Because Borlaug lacked formal training, he made the mistake of engaging in âshuttle breedingâ: transporting wheat to multiple climates to speed up their breeding season. Researchers at the time widely believed this was wrong. But Borlaug, in his naÃ¯vete, ended up not only disproving the theory, butÂ [accidentally producing wheat varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Double_wheat_season)Â that adapted to environments with varying amounts of sunlight.\nFinding validation\nWhile reading about independent researchers, I found a 1998Â __Science__Â article ([paywalled here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/279/5348/178.summary)), called âScientists Who Fund Themselvesâ, profiling several contemporary researchers who fund their own work.\nInterestingly, many of them asked to remain anonymous, partly because they didnât want people to know they were wealthy, and partly, it seems, because it carried a hint of embarrassment. Itâs better to say youâre funded by a big institutional grant than to admit itâs coming out of your savings account.\nThis is the dark side of independent research. Without external validation -Â __âI teach at Stanfordâ__Â orÂ __âI got a grant from NASAâ__, itâs hard to convince people that youâre any good at what you do. The same goes for your output: you want peers to acknowledge and review your work, or the signoff of a well-respected journal.\nI understand, then, why researchers flock to the safety of institutions. Imagine studying something that nobody else is studying, for reasons you canât really articulate, without knowing what the outcome of your work will be. For the truly obsessed person, the need for validation isnât about ego; itâs about sanity. You want to know thereâs someÂ __meaning__Â behind the dizzying mental labyrinth that you simultaneously canât escape and also never want to leave.\nAnd yet, independence seems to afford a level of risk and intellectual freedom that every researcher dreams of:\n__Fifteen years ago, this researcher, then in his late 40s, considered dropping out of science. âI was always well funded,â says the researcher, who asked that his name not be used. âI just disliked the process very much. It finally reached the point, sort of my midlife crisis, whereÂ **I realized I was spending 60 hours a week in the lab, and spending less than 15 doing what I wanted to do.â**Â Then he slyly grins as he tells the story of how he escaped from the grind that has become modern science: He decided to use his modest savings to play stock markets around the world. Now, he runs a sprawling lab at a major research university, and he funds most of the work himselfâ¦.**âI do science because I enjoy doing science â¦ I donât want to be forced to justify what Iâm doing because it makes better air in submarines, or whatever,â he says.**__\nResearch doesnât have to be expensive\nWhile historic examples of âgentleman scientistsâ seem to refer to people who were wealthy, independent research doesnât have to be expensive (depending, of course, on your field).Â __Science__Â interviewed Duke UniversityâsÂ [Steven Vogel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Vogel), who studied biological fluid mechanics:\n__âIf I had $1000 a year to spend on research, Iâd be in clover,â says Vogel. âI ask questions like, How do leaves on trees respond to wind? My expenses can be two rolls of film.â__\nSpeaking from my own experience, funding opportunities are often hiding in plain sight, or can be cobbled together from a number of places. I fundedÂ [my initial research](https://nadiaeghbal.com/oss)Â with a grant from the Ford Foundation, without any prior connections or RFPs. We found each other through someone Iâd cold emailed. The grants werenât big, but they were enough, carrying me through the following year until I joined GitHub.\nInstitutions can also help enable more independent research. Iâm lucky to have found an organization, Protocol Labs, that funds researchÂ [in all sorts of unusual ways](https://protocol.ai/blog/ann-research-rfp/). Having tried this both ways, I can say that having a steady salary (and health insurance!) allows me to do much better work than when I was worried about my next source of funding. Likewise, Harvard generously provided me with tools that an independent researcher wouldnât otherwise get, such as access to their library and resources. Organizations can still provide this type of support, and the benefit of collaborating with likeminded peers, without requiring a formal entry into academia.\nIndependent research as public service\nMy first go at independent research wasnât necessarily easy. I didnât know independent research was a viable path, and especially not in Silicon Valley, land of builders and shippers. I didnât know whether I was doing something useful with my time, or whether I was just a crazy person.\nA few years later, Iâve realized that the answer to that question doesnât really matter. Life is short. Do whatever you canât stop thinking about. Documenting your findings in public (regardless of outcomes!) is a worthy contribution to society, full stop. If youâre doing something new, and you care about understanding the problem, people will pay attention. Whatâs more, theyâll take your ideas and make them better than youâd ever imagined. And that style of research - living in service to the public - starts to look very different from the bloated, ivory tower models weâve been accustomed to.\nAs we develop new ways of funding creative work, via Patreon or actual patrons, I would love to see more people consider independent research. You donât need a PhD to study something you care about. You donât need to publish papers in academic journals to become widely respected. You just need a curious mind, a bankroll, and a commitment to learning in public. Producing work that makes other people think, and perhaps change their behavior, is the validation, and itâs enormously satisfying.\nI hope more people are inspired to take a leap of faith and pursue the lines of inquiry that consume them. And I hope weâll see other patrons and organizations stepping up to fund them.\nsource:: https://nadiaeghbal.com/technical-conversations\n[[Nadia Eghbal]][[Quotes]] [[Learning]] [[DO SCIENCE]]\nWhen my paternal grandmother moved to Germany, she didnât speak a word of German. But she was alone, in her forties, with two small kids, so she had to learn. She taught herself by watching TV and listening to the radio until all the words began to decipher themselves, a hard knot unraveling before her eyes.\nIâm not a developer, nor a scientist, nor an expert in any technical field, but I like listening to technical conversations. I enjoy being around people who are feverishly excited about something, and Iâd rather absorb their unfiltered world than have them treat me like a tourist.\nSometimes, when listening to a technical conversation, I think about my grandmother immersed in gibberish, waiting for a few, precious words to reveal themselves to her. SayingÂ ^^__âIâm not technicalâ__, while a well-intentioned reflex, prematurely shuts down the upper bound of the conversation.^^ Worse, it signalsÂ __âIâm not that kind of person so donât try to talk to me like I amâ__, which can have a dampening effect on the other person, especially if theyâre genuinely excited to share something they care about. Itâs the conversational equivalent of putting your hands up.\nIf you donât know whatâs going on, thereâs no shame in asking questions. ^^Questions arenât a sign of ignorance; theyâre a sign youâre paying attention.^^ âTechnicalâ people is kind of a nonsensical term, when you think about it. Nobody is literate on every technical topic out there. A chemist has no idea what a cryptographer is talking about (unless theyâve learned both fields, of course!). ^^**I think technical people are just people who try to understand.**^^\nMy dad is particularly fond of telling me how my grandmother fearlessly brandished her meager German at poor unsuspecting strangers, and when she inevitably made a mistake, she didnât react with embarrassment. Instead sheâd laugh and tell her friends how she mixed upÂ __Katzen__Â andÂ __kotzen__, and how funny that was. Sheâd ask what she did wrong, and what to do next time. In this way, she became fluent in not just German, but in five other languages.\nItâs okay to not know what people are talking about. Itâs okay if it feels like complete gibberish for awhile, and itâs okay to admit that you only understood 5% of the conversation thus far. If you only understood 5% this time, well, maybe next time itâll be 10%.

Couldnât get a single interview https://t.co/MRKRXqzify\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202446553174003713\nMe: hey babe, are you mad at me?\n\nLauren: no Iâm just feeling sad about our lack of communication today which is being expressed as anger and projected onto you\n\nFights donât get less frequent as you become more self-aware, they just become more complex\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196966562307047424\nIt took me 6 years of self-employment to establish what feels like a complete financial system, in this order:\n\n1. estimated tax payments\n2. expense-tracking\n3. quarterly financial reports\n4. retirement contributions\n5. insurance\n6. payroll\n7. savings\n8. business financial goals\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176354873098420224\nThe more ideas you write down, the more you have\n\nThe more you tweet, the more things you have to tweet\n\nThe more you write, the more things you have to say\n\nPublishing causes new ideas, not the other way around\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164643981453451264\nThe time has finally come\n\nPlease send me the very best articles, videos, guides, tutorials, etc on how to most effectively use [[Notion]]\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199052650131677184\nI finally realized why I generally dislike consuming audio and video: Iâm not able to use any of my strengths in reading speed/comprehension, info processing, note taking, deeper reflection, &amp; skipping/scanning. Itâs like being stuck in the slow lane with steering wheel locked\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1190056157257318400\nMe traveling back through time to give my childhood self a message:\n\nPsssst....\n\nDo drugs\nSchool doesnât matter\nSpend more time on the computer\nInvest in fake internet money\nYouâre ok the way you are\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176701384625770497\nHere are my current coaches:\n\nPersonal trainer\nEditor\nMarketing coach\nVideo coach\nBookkeeper\nTax preparer\nFinancial advisor\nLawyer\n\nThe ROI on each of these is astronomical. I love giving them my money. Currently looking for a personal stylist\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168701179003453440\nMy message is simple: the average person's workload no longer fits within an average human brain. Unless you expand that capacity, you'll have to either drastically limit your ambitions, or destroy your peace of mind trying to fit it in anyway\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166747227810758656\nWe've got a BIG announcement coming up I'm getting SUPER excited about\n\nHint: it has to do with @NotionHQ.......shhhhhhhhhh...........\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193700829598896128\nHow to read non-fiction books:\n\n1. Read first 30%\n2. Stop &amp; save highlights to a digital notes app\n3. Add summary of how/when you think this material would be most useful\n4. Search these notes next time you start a project \n5. Finish reading books most likely to be useful\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165822145550663680\nIâm going to write a survey of the most interesting alternative education experiments going on today\n\nCurrently reading books on Acton Academy, Minerva, Khan Academy, and Montessori schools\n\nWhich others should I look at? Looking for real stories, not theory\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188261959126474752\nIntroducing Forte Academy, an online school for professional development in the 21st century\n\nWe are creating an integrated curriculum for modern knowledge work â to democratize access to the skills needed to leverage the power of technology\n\nhttps://t.co/gq4uHRar2W\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199363498989494272\n1/ This series by @wistia is one of the most interesting and effective pieces of media Iâve seen in some time. They hired video agency @sandwich to make 3 versions of the same video introducing their new product Soapbox: with budgets of $1k, $10k, &amp; $100k https://t.co/AXFPaIiHK6\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196999420140670976\nLearning should be:\n\nAutomated, not accelerated\nInformal, not highly structured\nSystemic, not systematic\nPull, not push\nJust-in-time, not just-in-case\nSlow burn, not heavy lift\nLIFO, not FIFO\nMinimum necessary, not maximum\nAccessed, not memorized\nPassive, not planned\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189672340495298560\nIdeas abhor a vacuum\n\nCreate a folder for a topic you want to learn about, and you'll soon start noticing things to fill it with\n\nSet a more ambitious goal, and it will inspire bigger thinking\n\nPublish your work to the world, and you'll soon be flooded with even more ideas\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163464937429065729\nFascinating. All human languages seem to have nearly the same info transmission rate, about 39 bits/second (twice the speed of Morse code). High density languages like German move slower to compensate, whereas low density ones like Italian move faster https://t.co/ti8mXtuQMw\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171574985879478272\nPerfect metaphor for how I think we should organize all information: by step, not by type https://t.co/OpYuuSNmrl\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164353809323188224\nOne of the most useful @evernote notebooks to have: testimonials, milestones, and positive press\n\nIt's incredible how easy it is to forget all the victories, and only focus on what's wrong or missing\n\nHaving one place with every nice thing anyone has ever said is priceless https://t.co/lf7dl8h3jT\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1195454425747247104\nIâve doing a full Digital Jubilee at the end of the year:\n\nAll books/articles not finished will be archived\nAll tasks not completed will be archived \nAll incomplete projects archived\n\nIâm starting completely over on Dec. 31.

Nowhere in the world is like Japan. \n\nMy book will be:\n\nBrazilian Productivty: The Subtle Magic of Surviving in a World of Utter Chaos and Still Having a Hell of a Good Time\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171088111952179200\nIâm calling it right now: Cybertruck is going to kick off the next generation of design, finally ending the rounded, bubbly, cute and cuddly look thatâs dominated since the first iPhone\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200216494686326786\nDopamine fasts are for amateurs. I fast from a specific neurotransmitter each day of the week. I schedule my amino acids for digestion by the hour. I individually power down one brain lobe each sleep cycle throughout the night\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199095535933607937\nThe purpose of making a to do list is to know exactly what is falling through the cracks as you do something completely different\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167514460073775109\nI organize all my work so that if I dropped dead today, someone else would know exactly where to pick up tomorrow. Iâm actually the fifth person to operate this identity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197680830090547201\nFun &amp; effective productivity tip for getting started on challenging projects: small wins\n\nDay 1: Create a folder with project name\nDay 2: Create a blank document\nDay 3: Make a list of the questions/obstacles you're facing\nDay 4: Answer one of them\n\nEtc.\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163902753963425794\nIt is totally obvious that we will get to a point where every person has 3-4 coaches for different aspects of their life. A human life has gotten so complex it takes a team to manage one. This is why everyone is becoming a coach and it wonât slow down anytime soon\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168378334641709056\nVery proud to announce we've reached 1,000 students for [[Building a Second Brain]], our online [[course]] on idea management ð¥ð¥ððð\n\nThis was my highest stretch goal when I mapped out the curriculum 2.5 years ago at a Whole Foods cafe. But I'm so clear that it is just the beginning https://t.co/ZS0iVPhMxR\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163469245251850240\nI can barely contain the excitement and certainty I feel about online education. Itâs evolving, maturing, professionalizing as an industry as we speak. Weâre about to see the emergence of the Harvards &amp; Stanfords of online learning with at least as much credibility and prestige\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194058643907530753\nAny time I write for a European audience, I have to decrease levels of grandiosity, metaphysics, ambition, mystery, and claims by about 50% otherwise they won't have it. For Silicon Valley, increase them by 200%\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163911685427662848\nMy learning really took off when I submitted to teachers and mentors. Problem with exclusively self-directed learning is you systematically miss the same blindspots and biases https://t.co/NetQRTgttm\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1203046401283895296\nFirst time I've talked through how I use Things 3 from @culturedcode, the best-designed productivity app that exists, in my opinion https://t.co/9iQ0S8896P\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177273810568933376\nI find my intuition is usually 2-3 years ahead of my rational mind. What my intuition is telling me now I will only fully understand in 2022. This is why developing better self-awareness is akin to time travel\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180934440375087105\nCritical skill today: being able to explain what you do in a way that is humble without being excessively modest, aspirational without being arrogant, and that communicates your passion for it while remaining accurate and informative\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163090636058181633\nItâs amazing how the more academic a piece of writing, the less insightful it generally is. It seems to be designed to forestall criticism rather than provide understanding\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193041216402624512\n1/ Well, I finally took the plunge and made a @NotionHQ page, after armchair commenting from the sidelines for the past year. I made a workflow for my Praxis blog publication process, and seeing this has led to some interesting realizations https://t.co/190n47gBEQ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171214933511397376\n1/ My thesis:\n\nEducation is transforming from a finite to an infinite game as it moves online\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193642997025562624\nWhat if making education easier or more fun doesnât make it better?\nWhat if friction and failure are the most important elements for learning?\nWhat if learning isnât the instructorâs responsibility, but the studentâs? https://t.co/bVbPOfoUN3\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1192695597427351559\nNew desk setup. Iâve never had a remotely photogenic workspace before. Thought it was for precious snowflakes. I guess I am one! https://t.co/Mgp3BYbpSg\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160652377508237323\nI think the killer use case for a Second Brain as I conceive it may be self-directed learning online. I donât see how you can truly take advantage of courses, videos, blogs, other resources, free or paid, without a dedicated placed to structure this learning\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198779363640004608\nI absolutely love this graphic which shows how many âcontactsâ with a potential customer you need to have before theyâll buy from you. Luckily we can do this with content, which is why being prolific in your output is such a powerful business strategy https://t.co/MjnK9PYtIm\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185323418519912448\nIâve replaced reading 50-60 books per year with very carefully and slowly digesting 10-20 such that they profoundly alter my career and life https://t.co/VQuuzbXfLm\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184583560684097541\nThe best system is the one you use\n\nThe best decision is the one you make\n\nThe best path is the one you take\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200886298170413056\nYou can tell what a country values by seeing what âdoesnât countâ\n\nIn Ukraine, beer is not considered an alcoholic beverage \n\nIn Mexico, âaguaâ can include very high sugar juice \n\nIn Brazil, if you say youâre vegetarian theyâll offer you chicken instead of beef\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1190485965690699776\n1/ A thread of highlights from Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing by @mkirschenbaum which I can already tell Iâm going to love \n\nhttps://t.co/2vjEt4Lqju\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167805032277766145\nTwitter is much more entertaining and less threatening if you just interpret every tweet as a projection. Every statement about âhow things areâ is really about âwho I amâ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160487650442137600\nIncredible visual illustration of Building a Second Brain by the talented @Mappletons.

They tell you what/why\n\nConvergent things (courses, books, coaching) should be paid. They tell you how\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179561139790680064\n1/ Just finished @MichaelOvitz' autobiography Who Is Michael Ovitz?, the story of building the dominant Hollywood talent agency of his generation, Creative Artists Agency\n\nBesides being an enthralling read, it provides a striking parallel to what is happening in education today\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196911442441707523\nMy 3 biggest personal breakthroughs of the past 5 years came from someone getting very angry and calling me out on my BS. I think anger is the most underrated and underutilized emotion in society today\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172305973991444481\nLovely illustration by @Mappletons on how she \"captures\" information into her Second Brain in @NotionHQ https://t.co/PPkdIaP6zK\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185249258389176320\nFirst draft of my book proposal is finished!!!!!!!!\n\n6 months of work, 64 pages, 15,631 words, and an emotional roller coaster ride thrown in for good measure\n\nThank you @janetgoldstein for all your guidance and hard work in getting this to completion\n\nNow cross your fingers... https://t.co/tWLGrDByBs\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181664289473490945\nTHIS IS IT!\n\nIâm doing a world tour!

One episode will flow directly into the other with no indication or warning and the only way to stop it will be to get up and smash your TV. Itâs inevitable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164337281060069376\nâThe global online education market is expected to reach approximately USD 132.98 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 28.55% from 2017 to 2023.â\n\nI truly believe online education today is like e-commerce in 1999.

If you knew what you were going to learn, you would already know it, and thus wouldnât have to learn it. Note taking is so powerful because it allows you to do something predictable and concrete to enable learning that is unpredictable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201607857612836865\nThe key is to turn everything into an output. Every thought becomes a note. Every idea becomes a tweet. Every open loop becomes a task. Every theory becomes a blog post. \n\nTo be empty, to be spent, to be just a node in the network. \n\nThatâs the goal\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161424840974319618\n4/ So what could justify a $500+ price point? Itâs a short list: deep trust, accountability, group learning, true community, instructor feedback/coaching, peer interaction, future updates, immersive/intensive experiences, contributing to a cause\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186095423494086656\nThis is a super interesting approach to modern home ownership, w/out being stuck in one city: @ArrivedHomes buys a house, you pay rent to them, while building equity in a fund made up of many diversified properties\n\nAnyone have experience with it?\n\nhttps://t.co/rQW3jXR4yP\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162478570242899968\nI finally took professional headshots/portraits. We took 2800 pictures over 6 hours in a dozen locations. First round review resulted in 284 that were good. The key is volume. No one can look awkward in EVERY photo, not even me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179057539675123714\nIâm long on medium-length content\n\nPeople want depth and insight, but donât have much time or attention span\n\nText: Long blog essays, short books\nVideo: Long clips, short films\nAudio: Long podcast episodes, short audiobooks\n\nIn a world of attention scarcity, medium-length is king\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196968391120048128\n1. Only work with the best\n2. If you can't yet do so, become the best\n3. If you can't yet do so, learn from the best\n4. If you can't yet do so, do what the best did before they were the best\n5. If you can't yet do so, learn what the best learned before they were the best\n6. Etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1175109603480047617\nMy goal is to totally, completely, 100% optimize my ability to do the absolute minimum required to produce a given result\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189314750880145409\nA great student can gain immense value from a mediocre course\n\nBut a mediocre student wonât benefit from the best course in the world\n\nItâs not about the course. Itâs about how much of yourself you invest in it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183968378265882624\nYour big break is going to come from something simpler than you think, but harder than you can imagine\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202382234939998209\nWhere I hope to see my book this time next year https://t.co/DCrgAzVGM0\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193656325806444549\nMore and more, Iâm impressed by just how little information is needed to take most kinds of action. I think itâs because taking action generates information, and only info that is immediately relevant and timely\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193044216282091521\nItâs really hard to take innovative educational experiments seriously, because any new experiment inevitably attracts the boldest, most motivated, and most self-reliant students, who naturally thrive in an open-ended, less structured environment. But they would succeed anywhere\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193049686254292993\nI increasingly believe the ability to capture a note without specifying where it goes or anything else about it is the most important feature of a notes app. I can barely summon the motivation to capture notes most of the time and this is my way of life\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161336550409428992\nNothing truly interesting happens online. It happens in the real world. Everyone with a big following on social media is playing the real game elsewhere. Social media is the scoreboard, not the game\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199402931310780418\nReading The Body Keeps the Score, and starting to understand how trauma and our ways of coping with it are central to human satisfaction, aliveness, and effectiveness. This is going to shape my work for years to come\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160488396143255552\nI found the note I used to track my last job hunt, back in mid-2013 before I decided to try the self-employed route (mostly because I couldn't get an interview anywhere I wanted to work).

Watch out for it!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199067593962770432\nI just looked up https://t.co/utVXrWv1r3 domain, saw it was taken, cursed the opportunistic scoundrel who bought it out from under me, made plans to track him down and take vengeance, resigned myself to buying it for an exorbitant price...and then logged in and saw that it was me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171948183255011328\nThere are 2 ways to live a simple life:\n\n1.

Notes should have a lifecycle from birth to death, and it should be as short as possible\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194125586769338369\nNew kinds of coaching Iâm excited to see grow in the coming years:\n\nParenting coaches\nHolistic health coaches\nCoaching in specific software programs\nCross-disciplinary meta and life skills coaches\nWriting/creativity coaches\nRelocation/expat coaching\nDeath/end-of-life coaching\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172260684211597312\n\"Building a Second Brain is about unblocking the flow of creative self-expression in your life, by building a systematic process for saving and organizing your ideas, and then using them to dramatically expand your creative output\"\n\nThoughts?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162039943872598017\nMy 3 rules for staying sane on social media\n\nDonât take it:\n\n1. Literally\n2. Seriously \n3. Personally\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170819601619456000\nMy lunch most days:\n\n3 course, homemade feast of a soup, salad, and meat-based entree plus unlimited juice prepared by a literal Mexican grandmother in her storefront kitchen\n\nTotal cost: $3.33 ($3.88 with tip)\n\nMexico is the best place in the world\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161434374920794112\nI have about 5 deep work cycles per week. They collectively take up about 25 hours per week. Virtually nothing else matters when it comes to my productivity. Every other minute is designed to protect and enhance those 5 cycles\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193664769384992768\nNew acronym for every place I have to review or clear during my Weekly Review:\n\nECIDNOWT\n\nStands for: Email-Calendar-Intray-Desktop/Downloads-Notes-Open Loops-Waiting For-Today\n\nTakes me about an hour and I can go from total chaos to clarity on what to do next\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1195452177864478720\nEvernote: capture, divergence, analysis, decentralization \n\nNotion: structure, convergence, synthesis, centralization \n\nNot only are these apps not replacements for each other and not in competition, they are actually opposites\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181348322872676352\n@david_perell Is this Sim City?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1190781691188543488\nThis is an incredible principle for productivity and organization. Iâd even say the optimal level of perfection is well below 98%. Most people get frustrated trying in vain to reach 100%, so they never get past 20% https://t.co/jYNHWqzqzO\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189037398040051712\nWith the explosive growth of podcasts seeking ever more obscure guests, âbeing interviewedâ will soon carry no prestige. What will be the next previously exclusive thing to be bled dry by digital media?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184228836910583808\nExtraordinary in-depth article by Andres Gomez Emilsson showing that pain and pleasure scales are logarithmic, with long tails at each end https://t.co/ywHhqaaduO\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160495853938724864\nAirbnb is so infuriatingly efficiently priced. They know exactly which factors your considering, exactly the tradeoffs youâre willing to make, and exactly how you think youâre ânot like other travelers.â Itâs depressing to not be able to get away with anything\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160735345656229888\nOne of my biggest breakthroughs as an online writer was when @vgr said that âradical introspectionâ was his key source of insights, and I realized it was for me too and that that is allowed. Finally I could just admit and embrace that I was making it all up the whole time\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193665798121897984\nWhat are some good supernatural and/or mystical experiences to try out? Current list:\n\nreiki\nayahuasca\ntelekinesis\nmind-reading\nanimate objects\nauras\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176357500079108096\nLast night I talked to a remote software dev who âoutsourcedâ his high paid tech job to a junior dev who he oversees. This is going to happen more and more, as unbundling of location leads to other kinds of unbundling\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165399558857248768\nTheory: leaders directly regulate the nervous systems of their followers through their voice and body language. Leadership is an emergent emotive-physiological phenomenon, not just a concept\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1195446000409726976\nMy motivation to exercise skyrocketed when I reframed it from âgetting rippedâ (which is about impressing others) to âregulating my nervous system arousalâ (which is about achieving my own goals). Makes such a difference to align your habits with your values\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197983556493905920\nTheory: signals of credibility have become so watered down and faked, that negative signals are now more valuable. I.e. NOT self-promoting when you could, NOT having a website, NOT being well-dressed, NOT caring what others think, etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184248926171328512\nHow information has been organized through history:\n\nBy medium: books, music, art\nBy channel: radio, TV, pamphlets\nBy topic: psychology, history, design\n\nNow it's by context: in what situation would this info be most relevant and useful?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197206589813317632\nThis 60m Smart Sync Workshop, on how to effortlessly save highlights and excerpts from the reading you're already doing, is probably the best summary of my philosophy of knowledge management we've created so far: https://t.co/er7rgV3XPN\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189257048384573443\nThe very best way to organize information is by date created â it is obvious, intuitive, universal, and can be generated automatically. Organizing by any other means has to have a very strong justification, and \"actionability\" is the only one I've found that qualifies\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172208891377008640\nNew goal: zero-inventory note-taking\n\nYou should have as few notes as absolutely necessary to achieve your goals, not as much as you can possibly accumulate\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193663854892453888\nThere are really only 3 creative media that can fundamentally change people's beliefs:\n\nBooks\nDocumentary films\nCourses\n\nOthers can give you insights, entertain you, or move you, but these 3 are the belief-shapers\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168302239292653569\nJust hired a professional editor to help me improve my blog posts for the first time. Iâm secretly afraid Iâve been a terrible writer this whole time and yâall have been humoring me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194731341373292545\nIt is unethical to charge less for an information product than the level of commitment required to benefit from it. The problem isnât that online courses donât work. Itâs that instructors have abdicated their responsibility to set the right expectations, especially via pricing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164990643363618821\nIntroducing...\n\nRebuilding a Second Brain: how to make sense of the mess you created while taking my other course\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160717443263795200\nExtremely interesting: some of my favorite Youtubers are very publicly and explicitly leaving YouTube for @WatchNebula, a new video platform focused on education content, with no ads, owned and operated as a co-op by the creators themselves. Anyone else know about this?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199860610068029440\nYou can only capitalize on 1 out of 10 ideas you have, and fully realize the potential of maybe 1 in 100\n\nThe internet is a place where you can share the rest with others who might be able to, and they do the same for you\n\nCrowdsourced collective intertemporal arbitrage\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193668142242914304\nI've received an incredible response from this interview with @danshipper on his blog/newsletter Superorganizers\n\nIt's the most thorough, in-depth summary of how I manage my daily productivity I've done:\n\nhttps://t.co/951ZWYLpJU\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1204146302889672712\nWhatâs the best example of a game that helps you learn something? No âbrain training,â language apps, or âgamificationâ of an otherwise boring experience\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186501004465856514\nWhat would a solution to climate change rooted in abundance, instead of scarcity, look like? I think the key mental barrier to ppl accepting and acting to protect the climate is that it seems to require us being smaller, weaker, less imaginative, instead of more\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1192514475787554816\nWhat?! I just discovered you can connect AirPods to Apple TV. Our marital friction just decreased by 50% https://t.co/A8K2eQHEpe\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1191554409165021185\nAwwwwwwwwww yeah https://t.co/NNgIBu2V5H\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193617716701122560\nI think doing things linearly is way underrated. Itâs simple, obvious, effortless. Read books linearly. Complete tasks linearly. Walk in straight lines. Weâve gotten too infatuated with random access and fancy algorithms. Lines are the shortest distance between two points\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166470419462811648\nI'm interviewing @Conaw, Founder of up-and-coming \"note-taking tool for networked thought\" [[@RoamResearch]] on 12/12 at 10am PT\n\nWe'll talk about the big ideas behind Roam's design, its biggest influences, and how it helps people work in new ways\n\nRegister: https://t.co/6ECYfEzisF\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202659916369952768\nBeing prolific is the solution to any problem. A problem just becomes another piece of raw material to put into the pipeline. The bigger your problems, the more material you have to work with\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197214518306168832\nComplete collection of sketchnotes by @Mappletons visually summarizing my Building a Second Brain course. Awe-inspiring. Taught me a few things myself. Thanks Maggie! https://t.co/D6lF63R9l0\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181290497274347521\nI actually think books are just the right size. Otherwise, Cliff's notes and blog post summaries would have taken over the book market by now. It isn't the job of authors to succinctly summarize their own work. They are in fact the least qualified people to do so\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183412320959000576\nI want to make a physical space completely dedicated to online courses:\n\n-Zoom-enabled mtg rooms\n-Video/audio recording studio\n-Live workshops for prototyping\n-Virtual reality shared spaces\n-Classrooms for filming live delivery \n-Office hours w/ instructional designers\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172999447128600576\nIâve migrated my digital notes collection to a new platform 3 times, and expect to do it another half dozen times in my lifetime. If we outgrow our bodies, homes, and beliefs, why shouldnât we also outgrow our second brains?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194127108966113280\nInformation hoarders are much like home hoarders:\n\nKeep everything indiscriminately\nCrippling loss aversion that prevents enjoyment\nFOMO about anything they haven't acquired\nLiving/working spaces are cluttered and messy\nAddicted to acquisition at the cost of aliveness\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182151624896045056\nAnyone else notice a trend of ppl moving to Europe after theyâve âmade itâ? Usually after an exit or windfall of some kind, or maybe just early retirement with savings. Seems like once major career risks have paid off the lifestyle there has no downsides\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168643901986607104\nEvery one of us has:\n\nDozens of projects\nHundreds of tasks\nThousands of ideas \n\nAll of them moving, in flux, simultaneously\n\nA human life is now too complex to be managed by a human brain\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166784906292281344\nSo this thing I have to announce. Having to do with Notion. Itâs REALLY good. Way better than anyone has guessed. Just so you know\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194460799034519553\n26/ In fact, I think online teaching could be the most accessible path to entrepreneurship/self employment for most people, for whom their knowledge is their most valuable and monetizeable asset. Itâs a bright future for those who embrace it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186111560608972800\nWhat are the most interesting tools for mobile, on-the-go note-taking and retrieval?\n\nStarting this thread to keep track of interesting possibilities\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171539850224427008\n2/ First thing to understand: YouTube is completely consuming the low end of the market. There is simply no future for courses that cost less than a few hundred dollars, because âedutubersâ will do it faster, better, and cheaper (for free!) than paywalled courses ever could\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186093680236486656\nYour Kindle library should be a legion of 30% finished books ready and waiting to be finished when youâre actually ready to put them into practice. Treat the first 30% like a synopsis and prescription and the rest like the treatment\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165822431967076352\nPersonal trainers should link up with nutritionists and food delivery services to offer integrated packages including exercise and diet. They could synchronize their recommendations and put it almost on autopilot\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1175137988944117760\nWe need a term between expat and digital nomad â someone who spends 1-3 months at a time in a different city, diving as deep into the culture as possible in that time. \n\nDigital itinerant farmer?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160993056071356416\nThe sole purpose of my business is to bring me joy. All other objectives and metrics are designed to serve that purpose\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189673852533530625\nDon't take yourself personally\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177662725742186497\n5/ Deep trust: potential customers have to know you, your story, the details of your work and life, over a long period of time. This points to the importance of being consistently prolific. It takes many âtouchesâ to build the relationship (per below)\n\nhttps://t.co/amLRm4Olgd\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186095894220828672\nRequested feature: when I finish reading, highlight, or favorite an article in Instapaper, it sends the person who originally recommended it a thank you ping and slightly increases the visibility of their tweets in the future\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189368563154317312\nWatched Netflix series Inside Billâs Brain last night. Remarkable look into the mind of an inventor, business mogul, and philanthropist like no other. Highly recommended\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180588072326463488\nJoin me for this free Notion Office Hours with @mariepoulin this Friday 10/18 at 11am PT. I'll take you through my writing and blogging workflow in @NotionHQ, including how I use it to publish a long-form blog post 52 weeks per year with minimal effort: https://t.co/O98900vXdu\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184201686732034048\nThe next generation of personal growth will be showing ppl why and how to be present in the real world, rather than primarily online. And this job will get harder over time, even as the benefits of being present get better\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1173781474056790018\nOne of the biggest motivations for working on my second brain is witnessing my own remarkable cognitive decline just from my mid 20s to mid 30s. I donât think I can maintain half the mental stamina I could 10 years ago\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177710679060447232\nMy longest term goal is to be disrupted. \n\nTo have so much money &amp; power that I can afford to not respond to an imminent threat, to see that the market Iâve created is so big itâs worth someone attacking, &amp; to see my wealth redistributed among the youth...ah thatâs the dream\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163177330099011589\nA goal I have for next year is to spend less time on Twitter and more on Facebook. Twitter is fundamentally elitist, and gives you a highly distorted view of the world. Facebook ironically is far more pedestrian, balanced, and diverse when experienced through groups\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201348905230684163\nIâd like to see a menâs fashion twitter account or blog featuring people who are not in incredible shape. Ppl in shape look good in anything, so itâs not a good comparison to determine if the clothes are actually good\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201865685770440704\nIâm feeling the need to have my mind blown. Whatâs the most paradigm shifting thing on Netflix right now?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180279774914048000\nEvery few days I get a testimonial like this. How does one market these kinds of results? Itâs not believable. Shared with permission from @dvdaines https://t.co/DyoJP6K5En\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176303826485338119\nThank you to @teachable @zoom_us @discourse @zapier @evernote who made this possible, and most of all, the 1,000 people who took such a risk on something unproven and new. I promise to repay your trust 100 fold https://t.co/ye5rYScD3b\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163469886674235392\n1/ I've realized there's a really deep way of thinking about ideas that I think you have to have to be able to curate ideas of others, combine them together, and build on them with your own work\n\nI'd like help putting a name to this or references to existing terms\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165720885048815618\nIn about an hour and a half, me and 279 of the most badass learners and doers in the world kick off an epic journey of knowledge transformation. Iâve never been so excited https://t.co/8wjaTP5yky\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179537109796835328\nTwitter is a crowdsourced research tool with retweets instead of citations, comments instead of peer review, links instead of references, weighted according to past contributions as indicated by follower count\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188689399929688064\nThe most amazing thing about trauma Iâve seen time and again is that it doesnât go away with time. An 80 year-old man suddenly becomes a child again when he recalls the memory. Itâs permanently locked into the nervous system until healed\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198815914327625729\nA personâs productivity is inversely correlated to how many productivity apps they use\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165069813447741440\nThis is the most unbelievable note I've ever seen at the end of a blog post. It actually scared me that I too might one not have mental suffering and thus not be able to write. Which is a very funny fear to have https://t.co/L1WHA7u0eP\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162421576496635904\n20/ No one wants âmore courses.â They want the results, which more often come from paring down, doing instead of consuming, reducing info overload, holding them accountable, and everything else in my list above. Learning is not a commodity to be sold in bulk, like soybeans\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186106781644148736\nIâm helping a friend through creating her own online course. \n\nThis is how she described the experience:\n\nâI've been excruciatingly writhing through limiting beliefsâ\n\nPerfect\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1191794522931511296\nWe're taking vastly more video footage than we have the time/skills to edit together into a final product. And on smartphone cameras that rival professional quality. The bottleneck has moved to the selection, triage, organization, editing stage = huge business opportunity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177287859918667776\n#1 priority for any app in which reading takes place should be âmaintaining reader motivationâ:\n\n-Logarithmic scroll bar that moves faster as you go\n-Breaking text into shorter paragraphs\n-Ability to sort articles by length/reading time\n-Show top highlights &amp; most skipped ones\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165045397510688769\nI should really combine all my dreams into one: online course incubator deep in the southern Brazilian jungles, fueled by psychedelics and metaphysical experiences, including sci-fi prototyping workshops and a youth track and led by coaches\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179043868320227329\nIâve reached 10k followers, same number @[[vgr]] had when I joined in 2013 to follow him. I thought life must be grand when you have so many ppl who want to hear from you. Itâs even better than I expected\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163851211197558790\n1/ Iâm going down the rabbit hole on one of the most fascinating developments in online courses Iâve seen: investigative reporting-style YouTube videos about dishonest practices\n\nMostly Coffeezilla which has a whole series investigating âfake gurusâ https://t.co/kOi12V7Qjk\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194798457174687744\nIf youâre never an asshole than your kindness means nothing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172274224448385024\nIf you wouldnât be happy to see all your notes permanently erased, youâre doing it wrong. Destroying your notes through creative destruction is the goal, not meticulously hoarding them and treating them as sacred objects worthy of veneration. Your notes should be disposable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161515095463256066\n22/ Everyone is looking for the next mega-platform, the âYouTube for education,â which has caused them to miss the groundswell of independent, indie, mostly solo creators on self-service platforms like @Teachable @thinkific @podia @Kajabi who are absolutely killing it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186107789506072576\nEvery day I get DMs asking me âwhen are you switching to X?â with X being one of a dozen specialized note-taking apps\n\nWe should prepare for a future where we use many different apps together in increasingly complex ways, instead of trying to find the âperfectâ one\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196886736321884164\nSerious question: is there a good YouTube video on how to smile for photos? Anytime Iâm trying to smile, it looks forced and artificial. I must have missed that class in How to Human 101\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167639032257363968\nChecklists are over-rated. They only apply to processes that are stable &amp; systematized, &amp; making a checklist doesn't make them so. So it can only happen in retrospect, doesn't adapt to changing conditions, and provides false confidence that there is no risk involved\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163901656058216448\nNotion is near the peak of its hype cycle, where itâs the savior of all humankindâs problems. Iâm getting interested in it because weâre starting to see negative takes, which means weâre actually starting to discover what itâs best for https://t.co/rxlwJRXhe0\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197679107632439296\nGreat insight into why it's important to step away from something you're writing occasionally: the longer you spend on it, the more of what you \"see\" is actually in your head, not on the paper. Putting time/distance between the text and your head allows you to regain objectivity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200536865004064768\nMy thesis: the best online courses are as complex &amp; difficult to create as companies, but also potentially as profitable &amp; influential. Therefore, we need incubators and accelerators to help develop, launch, and deliver them, w/ the full range of services they typically provide https://t.co/MEPnmiMIlC\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1173014123677765632\nJust finished watching season 2 of Dark on Netflix. One of the best shows Iâve seen in a very long time, especially for sci-fi. Really profound exploration of time, identity, causality, relationships, interconnectedness, and fate. And German production adds a unique feel\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164755418918162432\nAt what level of income does it make sense to start angel investing? Or, what percentage of an investment portfolio should be made up of such investments?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200135469591224320\nItâs a complete illusion that ppl will only consume bite-sized content now. They want *insight-rich content*, and it just so happens thatâs easier with short form. A new generation of internet-trained creators will cause a flowering of long-form, yet still rich media\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197994991844392960\nWhat are the hardest-to-fake signals of credibility now that everyone is âX under 40â a âbest-sellingâ author, and billion dollar valuations are probably scams?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184247006123843584\nJust bought my first Facebook ad.

If majority presses skip button then it skips to next video\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183541659432185856\n1/ Just did a little security audit on my passwords.

Because you invested a part of yourself in it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169086826725830663\nThis line from Let My People Go Surfing really resonates with me.

I'll take you through the blogging workflow that I use to publish at least one blog post per week, 52 weeks per year, with minimal effort. Register here: https://t.co/O98900vXdu\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183783763714568192\nThere are two kinds of Twitter users: those who view it as a performance, and those who view it as a conversation. \n\nIâm firmly in the performance camp. I still think itâs weird when ppl respond\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162128182792916992\nI read that in traditional college you're basically paying for 3 things:\n\n1. Mind-expanding liberal education\n2. Vocational training\n3. Credibility signaling\n\nHow would you rank these in terms of how much tangible value they've given you since graduating, from most to least?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186406331059560448\nMy editor said the subtitle \"How to Transform Information Overload into Creative Output\" was \"flat and transactional.\"\n\nWhat do you think of these alternatives?\n\nTitle: Building a Second Brain\nSubtitle: https://t.co/sjWJk29VAs\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180910963307864064\nIâm going to calculate what each of them costs per hour.

Mark my words\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172364806285774850\nI'm starting to think the most important factor in managing a portfolio of projects is variability in completion timelines. If I go more than a few days without a completion I start to lose all motivation. I don't understand how ppl work exclusively on long-term projects\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161667404285411334\nIf you never make a mistake or fail in public, you never get the opportunity to lean on the grace of others, which means you never discover how much they really love you, which reinforces the belief that you are alone and unsupported\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1175093140073529344\nThat education is getting unbundled and rebundled, that personal and professional growth are converging, and that the best education can scale across the world https://t.co/0gravOh65w\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201590419450212352\nIâd rather be hacked than do all this work https://t.co/bNOFFxj3dC\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184217973705396226\nThe more someone pays for your information product, the less content you should give them. See their payment as a way to NOT have to consume content. Instead, give them targeted coaching and hands on consulting\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165032014631690240\nPSA: itâs complete BS to have a bunch of logos on your website saying âemployees at these companies use our product.â Doesnât say anything about how many, whether they liked it or got value, or how much theyâre paying you. Itâs also true of any product with a few hundred users\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196217342004363264\nPet theory: commutes are going to make a comeback as a desirable part of work-life.

People need to believe they can achieve your results without sacrificing quality of life\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172974787020255232\nI wish someone would pay me to just come up with grand theories all day\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201948072193904640\nMy book title if I follow all recent trends:\n\nThe Subtle and Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*** about Building a Second Brain\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193663144238956546\nJust do one thing well https://t.co/5L85Fh7sKF\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184579750725144577\nThe #1 thing both instructors and students get wrong about online learning: more is NOT better\n\nEndless âbonuses,â all-you-can-eat subscriptions, free courses, etc are all bullshit\n\nCourses are not toilet paper rolls from Costco to be stockpiled in ever greater quantities\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179490433094864896\nChocolate is going to be an enormous business in the future. More complex than wine, incredibly rich history, naturally mood-enhancing, and so much depth for true connoisseurship. Iâd invest in it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166087079480057857\nReading about trauma in The Body Keeps the Score, Iâm astounded that virtually every challenge w/ productivity ppl I work with face, from difficulty focusing &amp; paying attention to trusting others and relaxing after work, is also a symptom of trauma\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163320020161585153\nI only have 4 levels of compliments that together cover the full range of possible life experiences: \n\nLevel 1: Nice\nLevel 2: Cool\nLevel 3: Interesting\nLevel 4: Very interesting\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171995237234774017\n2/ For education as infinite game, relevant questions are:\n\nWho will I become?\nWhat kind of people are part of this community?\nWhat does the instructor believe in and stand for?\nWhat is the transformation I will experience?\nWhat will become possible for me?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193644445675032576\nWhat exactly IS accountability?\n\nSeems to include 1) being clear on what you expect from someone 2) providing consequences if they don't meet those expectations 3) direct feedback on what fell short, why, and how to correct it\n\nBut it seems like this is still missing something\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186689930149294081\nLove when someone signs up to my email newsletter, confirms their subscription, opens an email I send them, clicks the link....and then complains that Iâm mansplaining to them\n\nI mean Iâm not even mad. That shows real dedication\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201007456484282368\nMy rule on twitter: always mute, never block.

Preferably not just tips and tactics but what it really means to manage someone toward reaching their full potential and that of the organization\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183578790967967744\nExcellent post by @packyM on why there isnât a dominant aggregator in online education (1 of only 2 out of the top 10 consumer markets that doesnât have one). I donât think there will ever be one. Modern education cannot and should not be mass-produced https://t.co/nRNSPqhwCQ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189334475219636224\nWeâre kicking off the ninth live cohort of Building a Second Brain on Oct. 2!

It really is about what you eat. I thought I could burn off all those tacos\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184579638783295490\nWhen you first contemplate becoming a free agent, it may seem like you have to have all these immediately. You donât. There are consequences or risks to not having each one, but you can live with them for a long time. Just focus on setting up one per year and youâre fine\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176355253488193536\nWarning: DO NOT upgrade to Mac OS Catalina. Some of the worst bugs Iâve ever seen. Random switching of audio source, freezing and crashing, and slowness.

Keep your enemies close, but keep your frenemies closer\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198653518485176321\nIâm looking for evidence to confirm my belief that smartphones are and increasingly will be used for professional quality photography + filmmaking:\n\n1.

Hard to describe how much it has brought into my life. It all started with this post in Aug. 2014 https://t.co/0a2USqSZkC\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169661169046474752\nThere is nothing more valuable than an arch-nemesis.\n\nIt shows you have a strong position that's worth opposing. Most people never get that far. \n\nYou can recruit your nemesis' energy into a binary star system of unlimited gravitational potential\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161665491603083264\nTwitter: people-telling-you-you-have-limiting-beliefs as a service\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179770269659013120\nWhy are people so offended by this? With all the shitposting I do, this casual observation is what really gets to them? I think it touches on a sense of being alone, unsupported, unappreciated, and the idea that everyone will have a team of coaches feels too good to be true https://t.co/QcBybC5zHq\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168925047689490433\nEvery generation of productivity apps solves a problem, and then creates a new one:\n\nTask managers: now I can write down my tasks, but how about notes?\n\nEvernote: now I can write down my notes, but how about projects?\n\nNotion: now I can manage my projects, but how about...\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181380631789367297\nRelated to this, the best and easiest way to say no is simply âI decline.â Any reason or justification you give just provides fuel for overcoming your objections https://t.co/AQZ5UanJV5\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1203032412986494984\nPeople will pay thousands of dollars for online programs not because of artificial scarcity and absurd tuition, but because itâs worth it. The margins on these businesses will be insane, allowing them to invest in a wide range of features and support that actually work\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194059075602067458\nIf the second law of thermodynamics holds, then every unusually organized person creates several unusually disorganized people\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189013905428795392\nI've finally created a PARA Cheat Sheet, a succinct 2-page PDF summarizing the key points for how to use the system to organize your digital life\n\nYou can download it by subscribing to my weekly newsletter at the bottom of this post: https://t.co/TVbM6hfEOt https://t.co/XJl2XXqhEm\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185987616820252672\nI really enjoyed talking with @mariepoulin (and about 700 others) on her recent Notion Office Hours. I showed off my blogging workflow and other ways I use Notion, and we also talked big picture principles to keep in mind. Register to watch the recording: https://t.co/O98900vXdu\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186784640507338756\nI'm thinking of collapsing my entire 3|Resources stack into a single notebook, and then just using search to find things there. Organizing it by topic doesn't work for all the reasons I originally developed PARA. Too many narrow topics that don't actually add value\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169661990261813249\nThere is just no feeling in the world like clearing your email inbox, identifying every open loop, deciding what would need to happen today to make it a successful day, and churning through it like a machine. Just as satisfying as deep work IMO https://t.co/L6q9NRmXTY\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166044372405612544\nPpl seem to forget there's an s-curve to improvement, where at first your skill/performance gets worse as you break up old habits, before eventually getting better. Worsening performance can be a sign of improvement\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166771748894736384\nMy heart is bursting with joy and productivity seeing so many amazing people dedicating themselves to building their second brain on the other side of the world.

I pay $1k/hour to my coach even though 90%+ of what he tells me to do I already know. Accountability is worth a lot\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186097276017463297\n3/ Every course creator hears âBut I could watch it on YouTube for free...â as a constant sales objection, and itâs an increasingly legitimate one. If what youâre teaching is a simple How To, YouTube is a far superior place to do that\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186094434250715136\nFinally dialed in a schedule I love:\n\nAll calls/meetings/admin work M/W/F\nT and Th completely free for creating things (no email) \nMandatory Sat off\nSun either focused work or relax\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167493171548479488\n.@Superhuman is fast, but through speed it has really changed how I clear my email inbox. Now that the bottleneck is no longer the software, it makes sense to optimize the rest of the process. I now clear my entire inbox 2x per week, and it only takes about an hour each time\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163508198625697796\nThis is one of the most intense emails Iâve read in quite some time about what itâs really like to run an online business.

A huge value you add as an instructor is gathering a group of highly committed, like-minded learners together. The more they pay, the more committed everyone is, the higher the value\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186097729186873345\nThe main use for a liberal arts degree is successfully navigating escape rooms\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202993876711161856\nMy visit to the Living Computer Museum in Seattle today, including the first live demo of the original Unix operating system in 45 yrs which theyâve been working on for months.

Which one do you like better and why?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171944348289646592\n2 fundamental principles of the internet:\n\nStrength of signal is just as important as what itâs saying (leads to clickbait, outrage porn, extremist content)\n\nTrying to monetize through the same channel you communicate with is death (why journalism &amp; publishing arenât profitable)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172969650646212609\nThe pursuit of knowledge makes you steadily more ignorant because 1) you discover more things you donât know faster than you can know them 2) you know a smaller % of all the knowledge that has been produced by civilization\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183189745364434944\nEach tweet is like a sonar ping, and youâre a submarine tracking the deep sea monster that is the collective unconscious.

Or existing lists of librarians active on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166382306698809344\nIf I taught in a university, my course would be the initial freshman orientation that everyone must take before classes start, because it would be embarrassing to everyone that youâve reached college without really knowing how to take notes\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179505665007439872\nOur new video on The Creative Process Workshop is live!\n\nIt's a workshop on how @david_perell and I think creativity works in an age of information abundance, taught through the medium of writing\n\nJoin me in SÃ£o Paulo on 12/12! https://t.co/mcH8KJAueV\n\nhttps://t.co/vvG2eiomT8\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197301219653378048\nI finally realized why Iâm interested in lightweight media creation as an end in itself: at some threshold of ease of use, it stops being an all-consuming technical skill and becomes a meta skill that can be used to test ideas. Weâre reaching that threshold now\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176339985471066112\nI donât use mental models. I swim dynamically in the ever-changing vortex of raw data, synthesizing meaning out of pure volition. With no attachment to the past nor clinging to a desired future, Iâm able to see reality as it is without any mediation by preconceived frames\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165815895635030016\nOk this is amazing. Think about the post production a video like this would have cost in the last.

Itâs figuring out the fundamentally new way of working that it enables, which will be applicable far beyond one app\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172970004813250560\nIn an hour I'm recording an interview w/ @eriktorenberg for @villageglobal podcast. What should we talk about? What do you want to know?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167578454818091008\nMy god Iâve just realized the fundamental flaw with showing âtop highlightsâ in an article or ebook: it encourages you to go faster, to skip ahead, at just the moment you should be slowing down. What we really need is âworst highlightsâ which would be the right time to skip ahead\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165046857690542081\nItâs beginning to feel like Iâm treating the symptoms, the coping mechanisms and hypervigilance that keep ppl from doing their best work. Trauma seems to be the background to so much we take for granted as just part of the human experience. What if it doesnât have to be?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163320518088355840\nIf I was going to take a content marketing course, this is the one I'd take.

If you could have all the results of learning, w/out having to learn anything, wouldn't you take it?

Office buildings everywhere lay shuttered and desolate. Vast throngs of digital nomads pour through the streets, shouting into their 27th generation airpods, as the dust from their stampede blots out the sun in a grey haze\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186460299081052160\nYour leverage is directly proportional to the percentage of your thinking that takes place outside your brain\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193668935020883968\nWhat is the most visually beautiful and functionally well-designed online course you've ever seen?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186401521887367168\nI think itâs really important for more ppl to share their income and its progression openly like this.

They said âcharges are based on last monthâs average count,â which means they charge you upfront at the beginning and retroactively at the end. Very dark https://t.co/unMKQ9l0eM\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180528964642594816\nIf you donât send me a calendar invite, the meeting doesnât exist.

Youâre basically dead to me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169299424226336769\nIâm definitely going to teach a class on documentary filmmaking next year. Itâs barely going to touch on camerawork, audio, or editing.

Itâs much more effective to know very little (beginnerâs mind + help from others) or to know a lot (embodied expertise + experience)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1192523602622582784\nI figured out the strongest signal of credibility: invisibility. Google searches turn up empty. No web presence or social media. No government identification. Facial recognition doesnât work. No one knows real name. No identifying marks\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184260849122197505\nEach creative medium is like an infinity stone\n\nWriting stone\nDesign stone\nSpeaking stone\nVideo stone\nCoaching stone\n\nWhen you collect all of them, you have the power to create your own reality\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163453795830943745\nI was just informed that we leave Jan. 1 from LAX to Manila, and DONâT ARRIVE UNTIL JAN. 3!!!\n\nThis is a productivity expertâs worst nightmare!! Two whole days lost!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194114839758680064\n19/ In fact, the single biggest mistake I see in online education today is assuming âmore is betterâ: âall-you-can-eatâ subscriptions like Skillshare and MasterClass, to âmega-bundleâ (21 FREE courses Zomg!!!) Teachable promotions, to deep, incessant discounts from Udemy/Coursera\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186106169271537664\nThis meal costs $3 on my local street corner https://t.co/qAp7pbtLVQ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184559221733515265\nI'm going to start selling a \"subscription to my Second Brain,\" much like @nateliason does: https://t.co/IhoDNzEHnM\n\nI already have all my Kindle &amp; Instapaper highlights ready, but which other kinds of info/knowledge would you want to see included in such a subscription?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181632824895365120\nNew table of contents for the book https://t.co/hAtE7j6ZLn\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177661435012247552\n@MichaelOvitz 5/ That same shift is now happening in education. Schools are the studios, and they are losing their total control over the demand (i.e. students) and supply (instructors). There are now paths to market available for instructors to serve students directly, cutting out middlemen\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196913169303773186\nAbsolutely fantastic documentary summarizing the last couple decades of political turmoil and social unrest in Brazil.

They can tell you what doesnât work, but since learning is inherently a creative act no research can serve as a how-to guide\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193042253352013824\nI'm sorry to say guys, but the entire domain of [[Memex]] stuff incl.

The \"right\" size for your projects is whatever produces an intermediate packet of work that can be reused in multiple projects, forming a feedback loop #[[Maker Schedule]]\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165696597470175234\n@Austen Me and Elon Musk?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198814841982423041\nI just saw a draft of the thing I'm announcing soon. The one that's way cooler than anyone has guessed. It's EVEN BETTER than I thought. Can't wait to share it with you\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194676116868329472\nI canât make BASB cheaper because itâs not good enough yet. The cheapest version has to be the best version because Iâm not there to help ppl through it https://t.co/462o1XcWQ3\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177656603236921344\nInterestingly, it was the less glorified and more populist sci-fi writers who adopted word processing sooner, because they were less preoccupied with âbastardizing the craftâ than literary elites https://t.co/pgwDar1R0W\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170713269885161474\nFinally got around to watching this incredible talk by @clayhebert on how to introduce oneself briefly and interestingly. So so so important for everyone to learn.

In retrospect I canât believe my parents allowed me almost unlimited screen time within reason. Itâs almost as if parenting doesnât boil down to one simple trick https://t.co/dGjWpliEPR\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1191031937726435328\n12/ Immersive/intensive experiences: every great learning experience requires a disruptive shock to our mental models/comfort zone/growth edge. Students are hiring you to push them past the point they think they can go, as described here: https://t.co/EJHjv7o6Ic\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186100325091958784\nI canât even imagine what itâs like to blog for 20 years. Itâs only been 5 and itâs already changed my life so much\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181380031815139329\nAbsolutely loving these illustrated summaries of my Building a Second Brain course/method. It helps remind even me of the main ideas! https://t.co/myMUuaOoXX\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179497660379750401\nI've realized what I am: a freelance evangelist. Breathless enthusiasm as a service. Even my snarky comments &amp; skepticism are ways to make my message more palatable &amp; believable. Key difference is that I proclaim many, many gospels. Life as a cornucopia of personal transformation\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162065448873205760\nHypothesis: the world continues to change faster every year, yet the rate of scientific progress doesnât. This is why science is less and less relevant to peopleâs daily lives. Anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, and climate deniers are only the leading edge of this trend\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201345637200982016\nIâve been informed there is a new front in the Brain Wars: One Brainers, radical extremists within the First Brainer coalition who believe that not only should the biological brain come first, but that it should be the only brain. They are obviously a grave threat to our cause\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170467388292136960\nWhere is the best place for a small team of 5 to keep checklists and SOPs?\n\nWe're considering Evernote, Notion, Google Docs, and Trello but there doesn't seem to be an obvious winner\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164679063325179905\n2/ Traditional education was a finite game:\n\nWhat are the pre-reqs?\nWhat are the course dates?\nWhat are the grad requirements?\nWhatâs on the test?\nWhat is my grade?\nWhat certificate do I get?\n\nNone of these questions make sense in an infinite game\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193643574752972800\n23/ They are in a way a return to the âone room schoolhouseâ model, except divided by interest and niche topic instead of local geography. As @LauraSandefer explains in her book Courage to Grow, one-room schoolhouses were the backbone of the American education system: https://t.co/FSBF4IVaQe\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186109083134246912\nJesus.

It implies teaching is going to become highly profitable for the top performing teachers who are able to secure their own distribution. And indeed we are seeing individual instructors making millions since they aren't limited by geography\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196913774139256832\nNow this is a great example of how to use oneâs first &amp; second brains together: treating memorization as a game, using knowledge in a probabilistic/arbitrary way, &amp; primarily exploiting collections of info that are already being collected https://t.co/aSJDWZ1grw\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181051903897042944\nVisual\n\n          hierarchy\n\n                    is\n\n                              everything\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164643430938497024\nNothing gets me more excited than talking to budding course creators. I literally schedule them for when I know Iâll need a shot of motivation. So many working so hard just to be able to share their knowledge and have an impact\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196890530153664514\nMy favorite feature on @Superhuman is quick unsubscribing with a keystroke, followed closely by the backup option of blocking them permanently if they don't have an unsub link, which I use liberally\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194655114004320256\nWe are going to travel by car from California, south all the way to the tip of South America, and back up into Brazil, with our kids\n\nWhat is the youngest age a child could make this journey?

Main reason to use SaaS is to gain leverage on your costs, but that canât happen when it increases as a function of your size. Better model would be to cost less the more you grow, since biggest customers will provide best word of mouth\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176983299455094784\nPresenting our first ever Black Friday Promotion!\n\nIncluding the last chance to get the Building a Second Brain course before enrollment closes and prices go up\n\nRead more and subscribe to get the details:\n\nhttps://t.co/4ohoJ8MsQ3\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199759759718486016\nIâm enjoying using voice transcription on @otter_ai for stream of consciousness, impromptu audio captures.

It summarizes a lot of trends in recut years with hard numbers, and has influenced our launch of local meetup groups https://t.co/Z3cZT49xwy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181006457753354240\nWork on questionable things\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197910739433840640\nThis is why most online writing fails: it limits and dampens the idea to avoid objections and seek favor among a limited group of pre-existing readers. And in so doing, cripples the potential of that idea to find its true believers https://t.co/VgSACRtV6x\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197203605914210310\nFor every thing you overhype, you have to underhype 3 things. That way your hype budget stays balanced\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1195055817264959488\n2057: everything is free due to automation, 3D printing, and AI, but each second of a humanâs attention costs a million dollars\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176358299190484992\nFunny side effect of commitment to note-taking: I stop checking info sources (email, social media, messages, etc) if Iâm not in a position to capture interesting excerpts (such as in a checkout line). This results in less random phone checking, less distraction, less screen time\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1175119325197471745\nThere seems to be no book about the history of Microsoft Word. Only blog posts and articles. This is kind of a gaping hole, considering itâs probably the most important software for idea management ever developed\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162167761809756166\nThe thesis of Building a Second Brain book\n\nCompelling? Convincing? https://t.co/eSkP2H3JdF\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162103466304659456\n#cobranding https://t.co/5edRWimrCe\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202387292196933637\n17/ But this high end market is also difficult to enter, because it requires high touch sales skills. It actually requires *deemphasizing* production values, instant responsiveness, comprehensive âhow toâ material, &amp; polish, which is really hard for perfectionist creators to do\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186104588052488192\nOptimizing the single activity that knowledge workers spend the most time doing is not about gaining minutes in efficiency. Itâs about getting back the mental bandwidth of no longer doing something so far from the edge of your capabilities\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163509142595821568\nIâm very happy with this MOFT invisible laptop stand. Sticks to the bottom of my laptop adding no weight or size.

Multiple choice question\n2. Spectrum of relative points \n3. 2D terrain with multiple pathways across it \n4. 3D space with multiple axes of movement\n5. 4D timeline of constant change\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176329050652061698\nI just realized why \"who is the audience?\" is less relevant with online writing. Amongst an audience of billions, you can find an audience for anything. What matters is the energy and emotional force behind the idea. If it's high enough, it will scour the entire Internet for fans https://t.co/fO3yEbPlwz\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197203110155800576\nTrue freedom comes from submission to your destiny\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165397810549862404\nI love how in Star Trek they have interstellar travel and artificial intelligence, but rerouting power from one part of the ship to another still takes an executive order from the captain and an entire crew\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162450176683978754\nAfter a year of testing in small pieces, Iâm creating a new module on the âultimate guide to capturing content in your digital notes.â What is the best source you know on why/how/where/when to save content in a private knowledge base?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178748746768629762\nProductivity is my spiritual path, because I don't want to wait until I'm enlightened to make an impact, because I don't believe in abstinence or self-deprivation, and because my mind is my favorite place to hang out\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164640378076590080\nWhat is the best long-form article or paper with the latest thinking on how the human brain evolved?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198747795726815232\nWhat are you low lifes doing on Twitter on Friday night? Go have fun\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198035085573812224\nWow this new Twitter threading behavior is a direct attack on tweetstorms. My threads simply get cut off when someone replies to one, and I don't see how to reveal the rest of the original thread. RIP tweetstorms\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196926500282523649\nSome writers like John McPhee wrote or adapted software to suit their thinking https://t.co/3GLX9SLnaa\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167814964800679937\nIf you don't \"undo send\" at least 1/3 of your emails, you're not moving fast enough\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202631979981623301\n@buster Yes. I think itâs a form of entertainment. If we have to fight, canât we at least show off our knowledge of psychology?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196968601279811585\nNo conflict? No interest\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196501246913499137\nBASB provides 3 overlapping discovery methods, each of which can be fine-tuned &amp; directed to maximize serendipity without losing focus:\n\n1. Progressive Summarization (discoverability within a note)\n2. Notebooks + search (within/across existing categories)\n3. RandomNote (randomly)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188946060284006400\nApple Notes got a big upgrade in Mac OS Catalina. It's inching closer and closer to a full-fledged note-taking app. Soon it will be a potential Second Brain pre-installed on every Apple device https://t.co/RPeZ3f25eG\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183846259464925184\nI used research service @AskWonder to estimate global userbase for digital notes apps, to include in my book proposal. Briefing process was pretty thorough &amp; I paid $58 for 2 hrs. Here's the result, which is ok but I think doesn't show the true size: https://t.co/jpUyITKOeT\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181237105365680132\nIâm realizing that a Second Brain is even more useful for tacit knowledge than explicit knowledge. Being able to pluck unstructured wisdom out of the air and then make it legible/reviewable greatly accelerates learning, which is why I think Iâm able to get so much out of coaching\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169088007174938624\nHow we plan travel:\n\nParents: read guidebooks and blog posts\n\nMe: ask on Twitter and compile recs\n\nWife: follow hashtags on Instagram and save destinations\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166084241974673408\ntfw all the courses and blog posts and videos youâve made explaining how Evernote works are of no use when your mother needs some questions answered https://t.co/7wuBBEwNqP\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165808719474511872\n5/ One result of being able to think this way is you see ideas as \"blocks\" that can be assembled into larger \"idea structures.\" BUT crucially, you don't have to create all the blocks yourself. You can \"borrow\" pre-formed blocks from others and it works just as well\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722154031288320\nBig realization: there is absolutely no need to use anything but \"high\" and \"medium\" priority tags in a task manager. Any task you would apply a \"low priority\" tag to is only relevant when you're focused on that project anyway, so you'll encounter it there if and when needed\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163899289690660868\nA bunch of ppl sent me this article and while there are a few small similarities between gig economy workers &amp; online teacherpreneurs, this vastly understates how incredibly hard it is to make even $1 by teaching online, much less a living https://t.co/lm5nxfhjaV\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182744944923930624\nFundamental principle behind this is that action doesnât require more information, it requires less. Before and after taking action you need info. But in the moment of deciding and acting you need to collapse all pathways down to one https://t.co/hgnXPCMoum\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179769281795575809\nVery excited to announce an unusual &amp; exciting project::\n\nThe Second Brain Week of Reflection\n\nA 5-day immersive seminar dedicated to exploring the deeper philosophical implications of cognitive extension\n\nMay 2020 at the Chateau d'Orion, France\n\nJoin us!\n\nhttps://t.co/5X53chFa8t\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177275644549271552\nPreliminary analysis of our spending after 8 months in Mexico City: personal spending is a little lower ($4,500 vs $5,150 in SF); business spending is the same ($5,200); biggest difference is in quality of life due to lower costs for services, more travel, cheaper rent/food\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167525591148462080\n8/ No one wants to join some group just to hang out. You have to solve a real problem just to be on their radar. They come for the solution to a problem, and then stay for the community (the ones that are really into it, who you should focus on)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193647087813967872\nSo the opposite of \"Do Not Disturb Mode\" would be \"Disturb Mode\"?

Only work on what you feel like, when you feel like it, even if that means it takes months for a single post to make it to completion\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171217174221836288\nNow that @TheLaurenValdez is active on Twitter weâre arguing about who gets to tweet the clever and funny things we talk about\n\nFirst come, first tweet I say\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202062431532400642\n8/ But I think honest course creators need to be hyperscrupulous in avoiding any sign of these practices. Iâm starting a note to document what they are so we can avoid them https://t.co/f0nqe9MMle\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194802153082146817\nI had a great time facilitating The Creative Process workshop with @david_perell at the DCG Summit this week.

Hereâs the description https://t.co/3S1A856uEP\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188561661369696256\n9/ Instructor feedback/coaching: anyone can follow instructions, a how to video, or a tutorial, but you still donât know if you did it right. Providing feedback/coaching on a studentâs work is priceless, making the learning personal and meaningful. But this requires a small group\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186098655645749249\nWeâre reading Hayekâs The Constitution of Liberty for our book club.

This also ensures you need little motivation or self-discipline\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171217398549999616\nThe internet has made cities more important, not less. They are complements, not substitutes\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160996540132945920\nI un-paywalled my instructions for running an Anti-Book Club (a crowdsourced book club) due to popular demand.

Itâs carving out vertical slices, ie complete projects for them to execute semi-independently, which is a gamechanger\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172970452831985664\nWhy is everything related to video making so expensive? Software, books, plugins, equipment....I feel like thereâs a huge premium relative to other creative fields. And often only one company or source you can buy a product from, which is probably how they maintain it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168379417552285698\n@MichaelOvitz 9/ As they escape institutions and are able to capture more of the value they create, they will be able to create educational empires and serve millions with the best instruction in the world.

It suggests learning will get MORE personality driven, not less, w/ learning both centralizing (on subjects that can be taught the same everywhere) and decentralizing (on long tail of infinite niches)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186110265852481536\n8/ True community: to be even more valuable, this group lasts beyond the course.

There is a skill/taste element of figuring out how they are related, but not pure skill/taste. Some structures show better taste than others\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165721969813327872\n2/ It's basically something like \"idea concreteness\" â that ideas are discrete, definite things with a \"real\" shape and structure.

But it takes me like a year to learn a new tool because I have to come up with a framework for it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1199067174880460801\n8/ What it took was quite a sizable financial investment, but more importantly, taking a risk on an innovative content experiment, being vulnerable about their past mistakes and limitations, and recruiting other companies to be part of a story, not just a commercial\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197003643989311488\n7/ What they did sell me on was their creative process and intellectual curiosity, and thereâs no doubt my relationship with these companies has changed. I use Wistia in fact via its integration with Teachable, but hadnât thought of them beyond video hosting\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197003161384284161\n4/ This sheds light on education &amp; entertainment (theyâll increasingly be the same), branding (your mistakes are assets), collaboration (how to leverage each othersâ strengths), self-promotion (it can be honest &amp; authentic), and talent (itâs the main thing worth investing in)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197001289944616962\n2/ Is it a product launch?

It's messy at times, and results in more inequality in the short term, but is a profoundly positive trend, making knowledge more equally accessible\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196919177493336065\n@MichaelOvitz 10/ A few other predictions based on this historical parallel.

So why not postpone reading it until that use is needed\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164364904658165761\n@harmonylion1 All kinds. Another way of saying steps is projects, a sequential series of tasks leading to a goal. Thatâs why my PARA framework has projects at the top of the hierarchy. And a simple implementation is to only organize by projects and forget the ARA\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164364666472022016\nFrom working w/ libraries this year, and as described in this article, publisher policies for ebooks sold to libraries are insane.

This is amazing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161697318015553537\n@gplewis yes exactly.

Itâs a fundamentally different info consumption behavior than what I do\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181037636682600448\n@harmonylion1 @visakanv Itâs not quite that linear. My version is a little less directly coupled\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181014673405071360\n@chiaracokieng SO good. Iâll probably get sued though\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181005548772151296\n@JamesClear @visakanv Really? I never heard of that for books. Strikes me as similar to a âpre-headerâ on sales pages where they call out and qualify the audience: âAre you struggling with debt?â\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181005442006183936\n@joey_wickham I don't really find any negative effects.

No one learns how to tweet by spending time on Twitter. They learn it by having an interesting life and ideas and projects and a good twitter stream is a side effect\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180132987649720320\n@allenthird Summarize what youâve learned in one tweet\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179989396705005568\n@jonnym1ller No single resource can be comprehensive enough while also having enough depth. This is the problem with \"how to create a course\" books/courses/programs.

You have to be able to capture any idea or note, from any source, at any time, and trust that it will find its way to one of the 40 posts you have in progress\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171219276214128641\n@NotionHQ 12/ Everyone is doing a constant stream of these things, but it's scattered and mostly hidden. Your blog is where they become explicit and public, like a portfolio for anyone to see\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171219071938912256\n@NotionHQ 9/ Your blog presents your work in a chronological timeline, which is a good default. But you can also use tags and categories to present subsets of the stream according to any criteria. For ex, all my posts related to BASB: https://t.co/DzDYcRk1XU\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171218402850922496\n@NotionHQ 8/ Your \"newsfeed of learning\" is the central place where all your work takes place, so even if you promote posts on other sites, communities, blogs, and social media, all links lead back to the source, where you capture email addresses\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171217996188045314\nDavid Foster Wallace had a fraught relationship with computers. He used them, but preferred to work longhand and then transcribe. But even his work could be reconstructed and published after his death https://t.co/XgFkKNX6IJ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171089490242232320\nThere have already been cases of books completed and posthumously published by recovering files from digital media https://t.co/BlKLgiTD7Y\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170916517174829057\nLinear nature of tape invites splicing, reconstitution, remixing, and collage effects, echoing Dadaist experiments compiling poetry out of strips of newspaper. Sometimes secretaries had to literally cut and paste strips of tape https://t.co/aBv9PSMSDG\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170886555315187712\nItâs amazing to read how many chemical and mechanical inventions were needed even at this primitive stage. Here we see the very beginning stages of digital notes â blocks of text that could exist outside the main document, and be modularity addressable &amp; accessible https://t.co/lsTMecbU5s\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170879926922285058\nDevelopment of the MT/ST began as early as 1956 (!) and even the simple principle of suspended inscription â stored typing through changeable, erasable magnetic media â presented many practical difficulties https://t.co/EeN5HGfLsM\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170851038599012353\nHis device, an MT/ST, was a compound device made up of an IBM Selectric typewriter connected to a magnetic tape storage unit. This combo allowed for the essential feature of word processing â suspended inscription https://t.co/NmowgPGQhy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170850236077621250\nWe finally arrive at a good answer as to what was the first book written on a word processor. Len Deightonâs fictional but highly realistic account of a nighttime air war over German-occupied Europe, which he had to remove a window to get into the house https://t.co/UTfqtMNwCw\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170848843417772032\nOriginally, oral dictation was considered just as much a part of word processing as full screen text editing. Word processors had dedicated capabilities for recording audio that were quite sophisticated, including remote access, auto cartridge loading, &amp; continuous recording https://t.co/1HiGA2am5u\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170839017660866560\nWord processing as a practice and a concept rode the wave of the âpaperwork explosionâ that executives faced, which was the earliest incarnation of the more general info explosion. WP both addressed the need to process more paperwork, and also contributed to it https://t.co/dfjtCQfzIE\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170831074492059651\nWord processing was initially conceived as the female counterpart to spreadsheets, drawing on earlier stereotypes of women as typists on typewriters https://t.co/wsoFl4CCXC\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170752193282093056\n@vgr I feel like there are a ton of gems in this thread for you. Nexus of computing, writing, &amp; sci-fi feels rich for the kind of thinking you do. Thereâs some theorizing &amp; model building needed in this area I think.

I'm much less interested in what is true, more in what is useful.

I use Google's free Authenticator app. You just take a picture of a QR code on the screen and then it generates a unique code which you then have to enter\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161474345077600256\n@1Password 3/ I just went through the categories one at a time, changing passwords that were compromised/vulnerable (according to recent leaks), reused (for more than 1 acct), weak (too short or easy to guess)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161473752175001602\n@TheRoyalTbomb It's way easier just outputting it all and letting the crowd decide, then trying to manage it all in your head\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161428718629167104\n@amelapay @deepATL @impcapital A friend of my parents who raised their kid on the upper west side https://t.co/A9RdABIDuR\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161301728672661504\n@procrastiwork @marionnjoya I just use Kindle on iPad and export highlights.

But I was surprised to read that neglect is actually worse than other more direct kinds of trauma.

Weâll need to standardize our shooting in the future\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197308962959290368\n@rforster262 @MichaelOvitz I think the younger the student, the longer it will take to go online and more regulated it will be. Although I recently say an article that kids are watching so much Peppa the Pig that theyâre developing British accents so might not take long\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197162834154508290\n@JeremieRykner Yeah it seems like agencies themselves eventually get disintermediated as well.

Although there are celebrity doctors that I think fit this model\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197161016229974018\n@_PrateekArora I think itâs more about the structure of the work then itâs duration\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196993488513945601\n@max_eyr Perfect thanks\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196928487954759682\n@max_eyr Yes definitely. Studios balked when actors/directors started to demand % revenue share in their films. But it quickly proved worth doing because the most popular artists almost guaranteed the success of the films they appeared in. Similar will happen in education I think\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196925624755077120\n@MichaelOvitz 16/ My question: what do the talent agencies and full-service VCs of online education look like? Who will broker the quickly shifting balance of power between teachers and institutions and students? Who will sell the shovels?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196918746817990658\n@MichaelOvitz 15/ This doesn't mean brands won't matter. In fact they'll matter more than ever as the market fragments. But they will be brands not defined by geography of a school building, but by interests, passions, beliefs, goals â by niches, wherever they are located\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196918540252655618\n@MichaelOvitz 14/ I believe even today this segment is undercounted, because what they offer often doesn't look like a \"course\" (memberships, masterminds, coaching, content). This is because they are the first online-first educational format, unlike the others grafted on from trad'l schooling\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196918322320879619\n@MichaelOvitz 12/ Just as movies became brands unto themselves, courses will too, with spinoffs, sequels, merchandise, toys, multilingual translations, live conferences, meetups, cosplays, fan clubs, cult classics, syndication and serialization\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196916757438566400\n@TheEricAnderson Thatâs why itâs an integrated method, not actual integrations that will succeed over the long term\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196887188564258818\n@david_perell Ouch.

Itâs BS when itâs âemployees at these companies use usâ because that carries zero meaning\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196502998157025280\n@cigardubey If you want to build a business, youâve gotta go with owned platforms like Teachable.

Iâll check it out\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1192286792793374720\n@Joelliechty Yes basically.

Let me do some research first\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188475066197012480\n@BillSeitz I pretty much need ones that have a book written on them.

Start with a paid email course. No website required\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185937335151550465\n@clayhebert But honestly what I really recommend is archiving all that and starting over with a blank slate.

The skill required to frame and execute these effectively is ALSO part of why theyâre meaningful signals (everything proves my point in other words)\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184609494585622528\n@eli_schiff @StillUpMySleeve Yeah these can all go very sideways. But thatâs in part also what makes them valuable and expensive, the risk that you take on.

They're the Apple of task managers\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182329709809389568\n@fadipali Track changes!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182308828169113600\n@fadipali It's important that it be possibly, and relatively easy, but not that it be immediate. Referencing the source is actually a pretty rare event unless you're doing hardcore research\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182308714922950656\n@SriniKadamati We live a few blocks away from the house\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182040130778882048\n@Caleb_Allen Some kinds, but not all\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182039956505522176\n@Ceasar_Bautista @Conaw Thatâs because itâs not a good model at all. Knowledge and itâs mgmt are not nearly as formal, explicit, disembodied, abstract, or technical as those old white guys thought. Itâs like trying to model modern tech on steampunk paradigms. Itâs romantic but fundamentally broken\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181737504128421888\n@cwdaniels No not really\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181737040242626560\n@realglenndixon Your own health records. Read my PARA series for many examples\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181690124964286464\n@DevDistracted *politely required\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181672241798365186\n@tumi_ferrer I'll use the interchangeable depending on the context, but for the canonical CODE I need a specific word\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181632928683479040\n@pierce_works You make things. Once you start making things, you realize there's hardly anything good out there\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181614992199581696\n@JimmyRis true\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181603395011956736\n@davidklaing Yes but capture also requires some explanation. It's not a verb usually used for information\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181603362359275520\n@tasshinfogleman That the collection phase is not natural or intuitive for people. It needs its own step.\n\nIt actually makes sense when moving from the 5 steps of GTD: Clarify is replaced by Distill and put later to be done just in time, and Review is eliminated\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181603248009953281\n@pierce_works Yes but you do need to collect stuff\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181601417817014272\n@jessitron Hm good point\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181600579153350658\nAlso true of Facebook groups? https://t.co/8Y5Em9T7H1\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181347570318077953\n@sachinrekhi @AskWonder No I donât think so\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181271284669394945\n@kennylugo11 Kind of boring. Doesn't hold up compared to the quite bold title\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181237179390971905\n@nickwritesit That's a good point.

Probably not typical\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181044429731184640\n@_Suthen @david_perell Iâll never curate links! I only curate fine hand crafted content\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181040721295368192\n@MarcosPolanco @kokiriknight Getting Things Done\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181005663113109504\n@Knipps Yes but I donât think it works as currently written. It would if I kept it at Remember Everything, Achieve Anything but Iâm trying to go beyond that\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180944476014960640\n@coyotespike But ppl want to expect great achievements and then reach them. Surprise isnât a benefit to most\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180937533686829056\n@galtenberg Basically, but for good\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180937127703367680\n@kokiriknight No, that's way too corny. I want to clearly differentiate myself from the inspirational/motivational category, even at the expense of sales in the short term\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180919466047070208\n@RyderCleary There's already 2 compound terms in that sentence. A third would be overkill\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180912029848100864\n@jhooks Thatâs what Iâve switched to\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180529926711103488\n@khemaridh @Mailchimp Yes it is\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180529738688823296\nHad a ton of fun speaking with @ESpacewalk and filming this interview. Definitely the best researched and prepared podcast Iâve been on https://t.co/ymNZRbdd5F\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180526237858402304\n@HumanSelection I love that series\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180525153131749376\nMexicanos: que significa ânacoâ?

If I could live with this photo on my website\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179884318597844993\n@alon_gilboa You look 12 in your current photo\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179884210414186498\n@david_perell @RyanHoliday Nice!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179858673465618433\n@pierce_works @HiredThought Theyâre entertaining at least\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856307249012736\n@tjrwriting Yes thatâs what I usually do\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856156157571072\n@made_in_cosmos Because English. I make pronunciation mistakes and itâs my native language\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179855811645861889\n@grigorimilov Yes unfortunately\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179848112707211264\n@shaboom I donât make the rules. Books are books\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179847983623368704\n@JDanielRicher Yes. But the book comes first, otherwise no one knows what the method really is, including me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179844766277619712\nThis one would have to be over at least 6 months, delivered remotely, involve a couple thousand in extra equipment/software purchases, and cost $2-3k. Anyone interested?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179841454027337728\n@mesaulosoares Masterminds are convergent. They ask you to make commitments and provide accountability. But open ended communities donât\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179768002968870912\n@TheLaurenValdez @nowthisnews I think youâll lose a lot of the flavor that makes chocolate worth making. The tempering for example\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767811067060225\n@JuanSerantesG @micahtredding Because to take action you have to eliminate options, reduce complexity, make trade offs\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767243602845698\n@alundbergh Yes industry is my inspiration\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179766804048166913\n@vgr Like so many things...\"but it won't scale!!!!\"\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179607071286689792\nBtw if youâre enrolled and you didnât get an email from me about 20m ago with call-in details, pls email hello@fortelabs.co immediately\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179537339720196096\n@judell @twwilliams @tylertringas @kalenjordan I love it. Sold\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179509523284774912\n@Poyonoz No of course not. Thatâs a special moral failing particular to you\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179504598857310208\nHave you ever paid $1k USD or more for an online course or information product?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179492294745100299\nFYI if you turn the âextra meeting participantsâ add-on in Zoom off and on a few times, they make you go through a huge hassle and contact sales, get a quote from provisioning, and accept the quote. They donât want you turning it on and off as needed\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179446339916029952\n@davidklaing TOC only applies when the steps are dependent. Ie each step depends on the ones before. That isnât true of a highway with cars, where the cars can move independently. TOC is neither true nor false, itâs a model that improves thinking in certain situations\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179410676412014594\nLooking forward to joining Sharon Coleman on 10/18 for an interview on \"overcoming perfectionism for creative entrepreneurs.\" It's a topic near and dear to my heart as a recovering perfectionist. \n\nRegister here for the series of 25 expert interviews: https://t.co/e4qHUr7Rt0 https://t.co/NYnSuaiFiO\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179157468649148416\nEnrollment ends tonight at midnight PT for the ninth live cohort of Building a Second Brain. Here's a live Q&amp;A I did recently that also gives you a preview of what the live sessions are like: https://t.co/Ys8nCMeNWG\n\nLast chance to join us! https://t.co/FhrcAQM6vk\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179155794345902081\n@evilsizor Maybe an exception\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179084923782733824\n@NeerajT4 Yeah lots\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179084878702354432\n@PhilipSkogsberg It IS the general reference filing system GTD recommends, combined w/ project support materials. Iâve found that you can have more granular folders, as many as you want, as long as they are organized into buckets based on actionability, so youâre always looking at most actionable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179056331816177664\n@twwilliams @hvasquez Iâd estimate using total cost basis. But thatâs pretty low for remote work\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178902102573105154\n@hvasquez Thatâs a good one. So if their salary is $100k per year, you want about $32-48k in the bank as a buffer\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178879948888530950\n@unindie @NotionHQ Cool. So it's like a clean reading view of the webpage, not the full html it looks like\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178764801406717952\n@unindie @NotionHQ Cool. And it saves full web content, or just a link? On mobile\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178759914295922688\n@reneefishman @AlexSchleber @copyblogger @marieforleo Thatâs what I use Twitter for\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178192433135251456\n@HeatherDrabant Amazing work! I absolutely loved reading this. You have a very bright future\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178090082051321857\n@reneefishman @AlexSchleber I just like the sound of \"building\" much more\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178029252379213824\n@verohecko @JimEngland @epithetos Itâs too vague though. I want to highlight the concrete artifacts of creativity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177683937981648896\n@JimEngland No that's too closely linked to Atomic Habits now\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177682119960584192\n@nomatatas No, that's too off topic\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177681667495845888\n@epithetos That's actually not bad. It's already wordy as is\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177681605776642048\n@RSBodaway Still a bit too technical\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177680743037730816\n@daysofwaves It'll be 1-2 years before it's out\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177680706975068160\n@kirisima At your own risk\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177671870453182464\n@kentdebruin You're telling me...\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177667492266725376\n@PhilipSkogsberg Allen also talks about project support materials, which would be Projects and Areas stacks. But yes, resources is reference. You could also call it that\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177649440514949120\nIn 1 hour, at 9am PT, Iâm doing a live Q&amp;A to answer questions about the live cohort of Building a Second Brain starting Wednesday.

Example is Zoom. Paying $60/mo for 3 hosts is painful, and definitely not worth 3x having one host\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177027841851969537\n@vgr Taking a day off\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177024519598309376\n@jangondol Lol beautiful youâve created a new genre!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176953728617762816\n@Maxbaudasch I have a new approach Iâll publish a blog post about soon\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176953462648537088\n@tangjeff0 Theyâre ppl known for their prolific use of their second brains.

Understanding what you're consuming vs. not\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176596194627219456\n@HiredThought Ok letâs do it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176574604921491457\n@johnhanacek Are you trolling me now?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176573297150091266\n@JoanJaeckel @dvdaines Wow thatâs an amazing way to put it.

Iâd love some. That sounds like a great idea\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176494847491837952\n@davesneider Good ones\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176373887853944832\n@harmonylion1 Not sure but the dimensions should be orthogonal to the ones giving you the problem\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176366469665320960\n@davidb00ts How could I forget\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176364671453949952\n@micahstubbs Thereâs probably diminishing returns once you go beyond our daily reality in complexity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176355588525019141\n@chrisboden Probably not. I need all my thinking energy for my proposal these days\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176336859473031168\n@homsiT @getRocketbook They're just static images as far as I know. But Evernote's handwriting recognition works pretty well\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176334488512557056\nHave you ever been to a book signing?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1175258924158615553\n@araskin Yes thatâs it.

The main reason assholes are so damaging is that they have a monopoly on certain adaptive behaviors weâve deemed taboo as a society\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172964377630142464\n@kneelingbus That would be amazing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172660484769583104\nWhen evaluating a book to buy, do you notice or care who the publisher is?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172660053792309248\n@creativepockets To actually do it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172654903472246784\n@creativepockets Yes, a lot of time spent coaching is just info transfer. That worked when info was scarce, but now itâs a waste of time\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172654747507052545\n@ryanckulp Great points.

Assholes? No, itâs only in the eye of the beholder\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172626412122980352\n@codexseraphin Probably\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172585323190079489\n@Levotiate The one you use\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172574519124320256\n@kunksed Itâs all connected ð\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172362484549705729\n@ejames_c Very cool. Iâm not going to do a retreat in Malaysia but this seems great\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172361041470054400\n@JimmyRis Whatâs that?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172302516861595649\n@amymcmai That would be an example, but pretty specific. More like âusing data analysis for storytellingâ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172302450805497862\n@davidklaing Everyone has a little asshole inside them\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172288413610827777\n@uberstuber That would be amazing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172282455396511750\n@atthatmatt Oh Iâm only talking about indiv note taking. I canât wrap my head around group knowledge mgmt\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172268866661228544\n@JeremieRykner Great one\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172267437460545536\n@buster That's true, but I'm hyper-focused on the Overton window of when/if/how/why an idea can become mainstream. Probably because I'm working on my book proposal. For that purpose, I think timing is crucial\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172208466460438529\n@clayhebert I've hired ppl pretty much on the strength of their introductions. That's how rare a signal it is\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172187180032126976\n@andrewxgibson That's a great point. If there's no tension between the title and subtitle, you just put it in the \"always already\" category\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172186526387585029\n@Neats29 Yes but do most readers want to sign up for a neverending process, or a quick fix?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172186213639323648\n@lisadimona But the first thing I think of is \"Build a Bear\"\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172184936058519552\n@visakanv Yes but I think being circumspect also makes it much more powerful when you do come out and blindside them with an effusive compliment\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172184772254167040\n@Malcolm_Ocean @garybasin Nice. But multitasking has such a bad rap these days I think itll be a dealbreaker\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171960363715158016\n@garybasin @Malcolm_Ocean Thatâs the title of my upcoming talk now\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956612883304448\n@Malcolm_Ocean @garybasin Yeah I got that. And it has a lot of truth to it. Turning something mysterious and ineffable into repeatable, tangible work\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956001051836416\n@commute Yes exactly. Micro now means a narrow channel from order to fulfillment, not a small market\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171939598315868160\n@Conaw @jdunck @GwendolynHuot You can reach out to @efficientlibra1\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171867241589002240\n@yokosteve The information content per syllable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171829768880193537\n@Ashley_Giles Oh god no\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171829602433425408\n@santoshpanda I really don't want to make people join a new platform. I'm looking for something very lightweight, just to coordinate meetings\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171829399588462593\n@boaticus @thebandapp @telegram @wipchat @marckohlbrugge @uGetTogether Yeah that seems to be the easiest default solution. These groups will be used mainly to coordinate meetups, and won't be very substantive, which I keep on a self-hosted Discourse forum\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171828938907082752\n@CalmAchiever @braintoss How do you use IFTTT on your watch? What does Braintoss do beyond a notes app?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171627680946475008\n@metamitya It says the bottleneck is sensemaking, since we can listen to audio at 1.5x without impacting understanding\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171594783397036033\n@ManVsWald Iâm looking for note taking methods that are faster or more frictionless than simply opening a notes app and typing, since thatâs the default\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171550848863727616\n@m_ashcroft @ConvertKit Practice. You donât need analytics. The difference in results is palpable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171438331491545091\n@david_perell @NotionHQ Yeah makes sense. Itâs the weakness on the flip side of my strength\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171266625107980288\n@NotionHQ 11/ This takes some capacity to *notice* when a piece of content is being created that could be re-posted to your blog: a PDF, a Q&amp;A, some FAQs, a template, a video recording, audio recording, event announcement or recap, book you read, course you took, great convo you had, etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171218930871832576\n@Mese_Smith YES\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171156858574274560\n@Mese_Smith Awesome to hear! Do you have a link? I haven't heard it yet\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171155938327158784\nThis book surprisingly doesnât spend much time at all on Word. Because on the Mac, Word reached a kind of asymptote that very nearly fulfilled the ultimate vision of what a word processor could be https://t.co/8G0wHdz2st\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171102173566033921\nWe now have âgenetic textsâ that embed the history of their own making, like DNA records a history of an organismâs evolution https://t.co/0KuEIJ5eVO\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171097285142417409\nThe âtrack changesâ feature takes on a deeper meaning in this context: it essentially allows us to view a writerâs creative process keystroke by keystroke, in real time if we so desire. The process itself has become an artifact https://t.co/goRIkyRXA2\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171096819746713601\nDigital media also makes it possible for ânon-authorizedâ collectors to compile archives of a writerâs work, such as Paul Moran, who gathered a considerable collection of John Updikeâs work by regularly going through his trash https://t.co/x0lsn7SNvv\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171091161211002881\nThe case of Douglas Adamâs posthumous book, collected form his computer by a friend and compiled by his editor, brings up a lot of interesting issues https://t.co/RQsSh9hF8k\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171088783577534464\nDerrida predicted that the computers of famous writers would be fetishized and memorialized in museums, which is in fact already happening as in the examples below https://t.co/aKf8EQlix3\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170907039784218624\nPutting design, layout, and font decisions within authorial control, the Mac ushered in the era of âdesktop publishingâ https://t.co/VcxM0HO4V7\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170896634869424128\nApple Macintosh was initially rejected by most writers, due to its toy-like design and severe limitations on word processing capabilities https://t.co/5FMhkbNriM\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170895388049584128\nWow. Word processors allowed modern writers to do the remixing that is so familiar to DJs, musicians, and visual artists. It made writing into a free form, non-linear form of expression https://t.co/GR2aIaa2cJ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170894065417773057\nComputers began to become characters, scenes, plot devices, and stylistic elements in the writing itself, as writers could refer to details of personal computing that readers would now be able to understand https://t.co/ZokEPKoF56\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170890906033184770\nThe machine was marketed as replacing secretaries, when in fact it required secretaries to be highly trained operators. IBM ran an extensive series of classes at its showrooms training them to use them https://t.co/hGcOO6vGGF\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170885267412201472\nMT/ST cost a staggering $10k, compared to its predecessor Selectric typewriter at $500. They came up with a brilliant marketing strategy: presenting it as an integrated solution w/ dictation products &amp; focusing on high volume âpower typersâ https://t.co/O556HwDO8S\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170880674942861312\nTo combat this, dedicated word processing centers were created as descendants of typing pools, where mostly women would receive a stream of documents to be typed, revised, or distributed without knowing who it came from, in the name of efficiency https://t.co/hdIdf8gXUE\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170833799493693441\nI knew it! https://t.co/1IJMLfvCDA\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170828844993060867\n@thezhanly Not until chapter 8\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170821274244960257\n@Caleb_Allen Kay and MacBird eventually married\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170748688970526720\nAmazing to read about the conceptual innovations that had to happen, which were just as important as technological ones. For example, âquarter planeâ model that treated the background of the text as a canvas that could be extended infinitely https://t.co/TDnYhiBx37\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170745159555911684\nTron gave the public a visual landscape for cyberspace. Although interestingly, the use of computer graphics was considered cheating, not a technological revolution at first. Same thing happened in writing, where it was looked down upon https://t.co/21qsQoOy9q\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170742274180993025\nThe PARC team did many demos of the Alto, Bravo and Gypsy, seeding the culture of computing. About a year before Jobsâ historic visit in 1979, a young Hollywood screenwriter visited PARC for inspiration for her screenplay, which would become Tron https://t.co/VFJNBUF7ib\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170735281856831488\nLarry Tesler and colleagues developed Gypsy as perhaps the first modern word processor, with familiar features like pointing with mouse, drag, double click, cut and paste, undo. This new experience had a remarkable effect on writers, such as this one https://t.co/o3qfiYcfjp\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170734190628921344\nAs normal ppl started using these programs, there was a need for better user experience. And by better, I mean ânot atrociousâ as evidenced by this hilarious anecdote https://t.co/QcC98WDItS\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170733251360694275\nWYSIWYG kickstarted a cycle of innovation in software &amp; hardware. These scenes of employees &amp; their families coming in to write essays, newsletters, fliers, letters on Bravo are heartwarming &amp; show critical importance of high fidelity printing https://t.co/3gRdfcLuIQ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170728223103246338\nBravo text editor used bitmappimg screen tech, which allowed introduction of arbitrary formatting like boldface, italics, underlining. A demo alongside laser printers of fidelity of screen led to coining of WYSIWYG, which became holy grail https://t.co/EdNHQ5Apbg\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170724936165580801\nEarly accounts struggled to articulate what these new devices were, including the term âTV Typewriterâ prominently in advertisements such as this one for the Homebrew Computer Club https://t.co/L5u03kzf0h\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170714845664219137\n@arundelo Oh wow. I just assumed it was Alan Kay. Nice catch\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170708435450716162\nIt was a surprise to many that writers seemed to be adopting personal computers at a faster rate than scientists. Especially sci-fi writers. I think this is due to the level of imagination required to see their usefulness at that time https://t.co/NSacfExvbb\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170697822196383744\nSome writers didnât adopt word processors until much later, such as Ursula K Guia and Octavia Butler. But the shift was inexorable https://t.co/qoQlhkvENE\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170693905324462081\nWhat it looked like to use a microcomputer back then would be totally foreign to us today https://t.co/EY6BRxLgZ8\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170572790686203904\nWithin a couple years, it was clear that Ezekiel had completely revolutionized his productivity as a writer, vastly reducing the time he had to spend on mechanical and repetitive work https://t.co/bWCpp4J3Dx\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170572238132826113\n@tasshinfogleman Yes. Iâm going to war with the Girardian mimetic tribes on new territory\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170405731872509953\n@cwdaniels Random note is key\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170135781782036481\n@manishsinhaha @stevenmeets Yeah definitely. Once you have trust, whatever you sell is almost a commodity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170135506711175168\n@recborg Oh yes. I like how the ending is âTraums with Tiago.â Thatâs accurate\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169728450053246982\n@dorlydj No, it was on Medium at the time. I had a vague notion I wanted to talk about productivity but also knew I have a very broad definition of what that is\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169715708478943234\n@equartey Yes. Live cohorts always include the latest stuff\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169715494753951744\n@visakanv Yes thatâs the shift I want to make. What it looks like bottom up is completely diffferent from top down\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169675974721466368\n@viveksworld Yes definitely\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169488852475531264\nJust a few years later, by 1985, a 22 year-old Michael Chabon wrote his first novel on an Osborne 1. The era of âword processor nativesâ had begun https://t.co/f74f0F64mI\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169480846606102529\n@mariachong And itâs just starting!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169467950555774978\n@f_j_j_ Yeah heâs mentioned\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169458966213980165\n@lippytak See top of thread\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169458742372397061\nAnd as weâve also all experienced, writing in this fluid way is also uniquely enabled by word processors, allowing us to think new thoughts in new ways https://t.co/Luea2s6uw5\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169448307266965504\nUsing a word processor to produce such a perfected piece of writing, everyone got to experience a little bit of the sublime bliss of bringing a piece of writing to âcompletionâ https://t.co/bw7ziJhkKT\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169428244782706689\n@robertskmiles So then they can mute them too.

Itâs the performance artists who willfully misinterpret it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168934213481107459\n@kirisima Yes exactly. Itâs a war of projection on all sides, everyone screaming at others the advice they know they should take themselves\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168934067221487618\n@ejames_c Itâs already here, just low bandwidth and lossy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168933911407321090\n@northerncomfort @ClayNichols Lol\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168924346661986304\n@northerncomfort @ClayNichols What a limiting belief. You should see the entrepreneurship that goes on among the poorest of the poor\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168909083753308164\n@CaballeRafa @evernote I'm thinking of doing something like this. Resources is kind of a wasteland, for the very reasons I've always advocated against organizing by topic\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168908840835981312\n@offgrid_mindful Amazing. Thanks\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168846906161684480\n@clarkformaths Yeah true I wonder why Iâve never had one. I tend to have a mentor/coach for a specific reason and for a short time, and then move on. But I can see the value in a long term relationship\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168846414673108992\n@PatoBichara Jackpot! Thanks Pato!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168724768045981696\n@jasoncsherman Doesnât need to integrate.

Added\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168722691227975685\n@jonnym1ller Yes they really do\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168722611104149504\n@stevehopkins Thatâs not a very ringing endorsement\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168720395387596800\n@commute All the lines will blur. It will be about whatever the person most needs in that moment, and the greater your emotional flexibility, the bigger your impact and the more successful you'll be in any role\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168699126046806017\n@JasonBMcFarlane There's no clear distinction between the two. I make a living selling online courses. Mostly what I do in them is coach. Am I a coach or teacher?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168691762707042304\n@danielwithmusic Evernote\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168679712123543552\n@kissingsky @clayhebert @chrisclark1729 @tonystubblebine Mm maybe just do a lot of personal growth programs where they tend to hang out\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168667458950946816\n@parker_gibbons Wow thatâs pretty comprehensive. Do get full access to everything or have to pay more depending on license?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168643254750994432\n@clayhebert @kissingsky @chrisclark1729 Yeah it depends on a lot of other things. In my experience you just have to kind of encounter them in groups or networks or events youâre a part of. Super high touch\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168643048739344385\n@randw Thatâs why I start projects very small so they never need to split\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168599999094984705\n@davidklaing @eupsychian Yes\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168584741274042368\n@micahtredding No, itâs highly personal network and relationship based. Which makes sense because personality fit is dominant factor\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168581763838271488\n@codexseraphin @vgr And formal coaching. Relationship coaches are one of the biggest categories\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168581434845487104\n@vgr Okay maybe not everyone, but I think it wonât come about from who we today see as coaches growing to serve everyone. It will be the abstraction of coaching as a skill into many other professions like teaching, mentoring, training, tech support, etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168581035933618176\n@franciscohmello @wistia The fewer the content, the more expensive the up sell\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168533094640410624\n@iam100rabhs No idea. I just got my first legit office chair last month\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168347782853251072\n@zackkanter I was hoping someone would share smthg on reality tv\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168329997687197696\n@RLangford18 I donât really think beliefs are subject to falsification. Itâs why reasons and explanations donât really change anyoneâs mind. Requires something more immersive\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168312532638957568\n@JimmyRis Yes exactly. Explicit categorization by length\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168307455392043008\n@jobrodude I think those especially confirm peopleâs existing beliefs\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168307042873991168\n@DanielCJonas Yes definitely. Iâm talking external media\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168304468095463424\n@ClayNichols @parker_gibbons also available for free if you search\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168237855354703872\n@parker_gibbons @ClayNichols @themusicbed @SteveHullfish Love it.

Borrowing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167866290800775168\n@mkirschenbaum Oh I will! I'll keep it as a running thread. I have a course on digital note-taking and knowledge management (https://t.co/rJMaXWfBdg) and this history is giving me lots of ideas for how to popularize note-taking apps the same way as word processing apps\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167844410991808512\n@malcolmtorino @visakanv @sonyasupposedly Hell yeah\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167801044300025856\n@parker_gibbons Yeah that helps.

Super valuable stuff\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167173573452029952\n@angelgonzalez Hard to estimate, but it's equally the meaningful and creative work that gets squeezed out by all the BS work.

But that benefits are available now\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166799287201619968\n@Jonas_Sota Yes exactly. Ppl with âsimpleâ lives often have very complex systems working for them in the background\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166789031142842368\n@CmdrDats @RobStuttaford Itâs not more work, itâs different work. Youâre already acquiring the info in your daily life. The choice is whether to spend your time remembering/tracking it, or offloading it to a machine that remembers perfectly\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166787240250564620\n@ankurnagpal @teachable Yeah I get that. Not everyone is as open book as me. And maybe when I get to that point I wonât be either\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166781157922484224\n@corey_gwin There's also work for the first brain to do.

Since some things always slip through and thus I have to check them, Iâd rather have fewer places to check\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166026010459983872\n@AE_Robbert @rhyscass It seems like we can make a pretty weak claim that still is more than most ppl hold: that ideas obey rules, and thus can only be combined according to rules\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166025743001776128\n@Conaw Problem is that intro and conclusion usually say the same thing. I do need some of the detail of middle chapters to tell how deep theyâve gone and at what resolution\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166025403321839616\n@Bazzaruto Post-hoc rationalization FTW\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166002774183743489\n@DerekWClark Apparently a lot of ppl\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165817336080658438\n@SusanGroff1 Haha exactly\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165803358159900672\n@rhyscass This is part of it, but too fundamental. There are ppl who think world is rational but weâre not so no sense can be made\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165791747663749122\nBy how much do you have to limit the intensity or effort of your workday, in order to be able to hit a certain number of hours?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165760446936358912\n@puritanner I'm looking for the underlying belief, which in this example would be \"atomaticity\" or something. The belief that atoms exist and can be used to build durable things\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741567908466690\n@AckKaero @dppetrov It might be constructionism, which I guess must presuppose that the things you're constructing aren't just whispy opinions\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741325880307714\n@LouisComments No it's something more fundamental that makes those both possible: just the simple belief that an idea is a definite thing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165725655763431427\n@Gluefactoryltd @NYUGallatin No I'm describing a specific, opinionated stance\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722587298697218\n6/ What is this philosophy/attitude called? Any references?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722362580484096\n@vgr I'd thought of doing just what you describe with index cards for next draft of book manuscript, because I need more friction to prevent too much detail from migrating to new draft\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165720164815593472\n@then_there_was Yes. I have smthg on this that Iâm publishing soon. Determine categories retroactively using ML\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165637757466796032\n@then_there_was It took me a long time to learn these. They have have many layers of exceptions too\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165637348886843397\n@then_there_was Yeah I donât think itâs a note taking tool at all. The defining elements of notes are random capture and low fidelity, neither of which Notion does. Itâs more in GDocs territory\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165493557379121152\n@StewartalsopIII Not that I know of, but it is one of only four foods that have theobromine, which has known positive effects on affect\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165353703877967874\n@JimmyRis Dm works fine\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165133880594059264\n@ESpacewalk @jtimberlake @Madonna @ladygaga Amazing thanks\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165126136235319296\n@p_millerd Yes sure\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165126026302607360\n@akirathedon Ah true.

Iâd archive them all and start over\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165051135150809088\n@frogautistic @evernote @TheBrainTech @devontech Yes, there needs to be a central repository\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165046338712555520\n@frogautistic @evernote @TheBrainTech @devontech Youâve got to balance the cost/friction of maintaining all these tools with the opportunity cost of what youâd be able to create otherwise. What matters is your output\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165043899389186048\n@vgr Sounds like Portland\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165039012962168832\n@kelvinltse Thatâs more than most ppl do. A great option\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165031450753654784\n@ClayNichols Itâs more like low, medium, high.

Why not just add a 1 day delay the day before and schedule the broadcast for that gap\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201577862375051265\n@schlagetown My own. We have a forum but itâs for paying students only\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201551496648642564\n@TomFrankly No because knowledge is infinitely fractal. The more you learn, the more you discover you donât know. This is who ppl end up dedicating their career to South African burrowing sand beetles or whatever\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201551274098905088\n@NacerZemirli Why what did it say?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201532215122726912\n@Sathya88726239 High quality groups\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201532064010588160\n@DevDistracted Yeah but we canât put their address all over the internet\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201323105710268416\n@brunowinck Oh wow. What do they do with these?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201322994259218433\n@CantHardyWait @khemaridh Hm interesting. I think we need the email forwarding now that I think about it though\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201279350915530752\n@CantHardyWait @khemaridh But we donât need a workspace\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201277789615165440\n@mchapiro @artpi How much?

I wonder why they donât. Probably because actor wants freedom to work with anyone\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196937889634017281\n@svincenzi @max_eyr Versus freelancing? But some of the top devs also freelance don't they?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196930517737672704\n@grigorimilov @MichaelOvitz Maybe the scale of sheer numbers, but not profitability. The more niche, the more profitable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196926793707601921\n@max_eyr Any notes on it?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196926637532684292\n@grigorimilov @MichaelOvitz Yes but ppl will pay far more for education for this reason\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196925896449544196\n@svincenzi @MichaelOvitz That is one of the assumptions of the old model of education that is about to be destroyed: that quality of instruction declines with size of class\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196920068350844928\n@MichaelOvitz 13/ Which courses are profitable or successful will be harder to predict. Sure bets will flop without creative enough marketing, while niche plays will have breakout success as they resonate beyond their niche. Courses will resemble startup investing, with 1% creating most profit\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196917294649270274\n@MichaelOvitz 11/ This means you'll see indiv instructors competing and/or collaborating with major educational institutions as equal players. Look out for partnerships with Ivy League universities, governments, military, and school systems outsourcing some courses to online teachers\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196916058780848128\n@apukhovskaya Totally. It just becomes more things to keep track of\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196864813902774273\n@m_ashcroft I love it.

About a dozen different locations\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179884133222191104\n@araskin Good idea\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179880928274812928\n@m_ashcroft Well duh\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179878139117223936\n@Jonas_Sota Thatâs really hard to track and track down\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179878096419221504\n@IbarraDiego On the other hand, Iâm not going to put one on my website that makes me cringe\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179877835655139328\n@IbarraDiego Hm good point\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179877496650530816\n@wobbles Hm I forgot to exclude online classes from institutions which may be over $1k in credits\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856935710912514\n@shaboom I didnât say that\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856398080831488\n@Mattrud Iâve never met anyone who wrote a book who didnât have a lot of help from many different sources\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856019939160064\n@Mattrud Did someone write a book based on reading your book?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179849773030858752\n@m_ashcroft Not in my experience\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179848585002831873\n@daysofwaves Two\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179848171159195649\n@AkitaOnRails @thiagoghisi Ok cool I have a couple good leads\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179848064904777728\n@rjonesy Ok starting a list\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179844659926818816\n@s_ketharaman Does Google Play show download numbers?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179844300844097536\n@daysofwaves It will cost way more. Other courses need to be managed by others before I do that though. Itâs all consuming\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179842938077097984\n@tasshinfogleman I think that one will have to wait until BASB book is out. 1-2 yrs\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179842806484881408\nI should probably prototype this using a live workshop. Itâd be $1k in person in NYC or LA. Not including travel/food/board. Two very full days on a weekend. Who would be down for this?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179839483132276736\n@thiagoghisi @AkitaOnRails Oh really? I have no sense of where the commercial and business districts are because I never lived there as an adult\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179837184595001344\n@staticsteven Not for such a broad request. See my blog first\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830864592551936\n@JuanSerantesG @micahtredding What can be convergent, but usually people know what to do, just not how to do it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830654608871424\n@learningpathsio @evernote It can't be that hard to get a round ballpark. Don't ppl track software category usage?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830459322093568\n@mesaulosoares I'll send it out more broadly once I decide on a date and place\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830328233353216\n@visakanv Well Evernote alone has over 200MM so that's a safe guess\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179793585819938818\n@tonyennis Ok I'll try it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179793424511164417\n@Zenomercer Yes only dedicated ones\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179791098962513920\n@learningpathsio Thatâs a good idea. Iâll look into it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179768928781910021\n@purchalka Yeah itâs a rarified world\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767552748113920\n@cuongish Yes, it can never be completely automated, because the magic is in the process\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767489007439875\n@thiagoghisi @AkitaOnRails Why because of metro access\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767141060534274\n@kalenjordan But that implies live broadcast, aka live-streaming, which isnât the case. Theyâre pre-recorded and uploaded to a course\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179496698642604038\n@nollindwhachell But it will smile awkwardly if trained on my data\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179490556436762625\n@Mlad_Medunic Let me check if I can share\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179409823177302016\n@deepATL @KeepProductive No havenât tried Coda\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179409657091313665\n@viveksworld Total spending right? Seems reasonable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179251551459827712\n@Chiliandgarlic For now but probably not for long\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179176061617102848\n@david_perell It looks ok in the video. Itâs more the camera Iâm using to take this picture\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179090281284689921\n@VincentBarr Let me check and see\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179084840890720258\n@AvalancheJohn Didnât know those were the choices\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179056781936545792\n@clayhebert @pjrvs I read the book and loved it. But there are many aspects of the business that are highly operational and systems/process oriented that I donât want to run. And I donât think automation works in an education business in my case. And contractors havenât worked out for this\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178879609095348224\n@Tablatodd Love it. Do you have a couple screenshots of this in action?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178759247988813825\n@Mappletons @TiagoForte Link is broken and my handle is @fortelabs! Make a new tweet and Iâll share\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178745996391542784\n@TheRoyalTbomb Thanks!

Where is the best place to do a Creative Process workshop? I need a central neighborhood plus an affordable venue\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177708294141407232\n@covrter What is that?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177683812991373312\n@royking3 A little corny\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177683366872666112\n@covrter That's better, but still too \"manufacturing\"\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177682308448411648\n@chandra1250 No too absctract\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177682256892063744\n@Fernand0Aguilar I don't think \"creative goods\" is commonly understood\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177682218606399488\n@levity Nope\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177681689046159360\n@daysofwaves Why not both?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177680662779662336\n@PhilipSkogsberg Resources is the broadest possible term, encompassing things like stock photos, device manuals, or reading highlights that arenât exactly hobbies. Areas are specific to you, such as your health records, whereas Resources are general interest, like health articles\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177610573795610624\n@DeanCooney @fortelabs.co\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177609956704473088\n@AlexSchleber @CmdrDats @RobStuttaford Aren't we all\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177274076584218624\n@CantHardyWait It needs to be double booked sometimes though. Issue is we use it for everything from one on ones to big groups\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177038653710749696\n@CantHardyWait Financially. It feels like a side effect of the pricing model, which assumes high intensity use of each host, when really what we need is just unique IDs and only occasionally simultaneous use\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177029519850369025\n@CantHardyWait Their margins improve, but not mine until I get really big and get volume pricing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177024837090332672\n@clayhebert Thatâs why we need protection\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177024581128740865\n@JDanielRicher Wonderful. I have no idea how to fix that. Any ideas @ConvertKit ?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176954103089356800\n@kalenjordan Thatâs a symptom not a benefit\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176953562221334528\n@JDanielRicher There is one https://t.co/Kx521s6IJb\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176951824739209216\n@AbhishekKarale Join us and share it in the chat\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176696660019179520\n@NateHB13 Wonderful\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176695405905473536\n@mariepoulin @NotionHQ @kirisima Yeah sure\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176631556615442432\n@staticsteven Yeah some, but not my current focus\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176619834529873920\n@GeorgesJanin @TheLaurenValdez @maxholzheu @DanPierson We only get back into town on Monday unfortunately\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176607364767600640\n@coponder Havenât seen it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176401070798491648\n@MiGrant Well thatâs neat\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176370258413682688\n@bph235 Whatâs that?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176365432971808768\n@jonnym1ller Whoa nice\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176364982683852800\n@_StevenFan Good ones\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176364922340405248\n@MiGrant Ah yes astral projection\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176364516323381248\n@MightyFineCopy_ Hmmmm\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176364332780703744\n@feelsmartly Whatâs that?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176364288782372865\n@bquittem Ah yes\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176363971714015238\n@viveksworld Yes true.

Trying to sell text is really hard\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172987258468614144\n@grigorimilov Well since what theyâre selling IS communication, ie text, yes. Few ppl want to buy straight journalism\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172985255738740736\n@chophshiy Yes. Anyone can gain a few dozen glowing reviews. Hundreds or thousands is impossible\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172974255660650496\n@kirisima Yeah itâs an interesting gender split. I think itâs because productivity is more outcome oriented and âoffense.â Whereas organization is more environmentally oriented and âdefenseâ\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172963943851032576\n@creativepockets Jesus\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172934243795656704\n@worldbrain @harmonylion1 Cool! I love what you guys are doing. Keep it up\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172934036823498752\n@daysofwaves Yeah itâs really a big need. As far as Iâm concerned no one should even think about creating an online course until theyâve taught it in person many times\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172677256331661314\n#2 might seem like an obvious yes but consider that you might NOT want a larger percentage of each retail sale, instead using the book to sell something else like a course or speaking\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172656935054630912\n@HiredThought Thatâs what truly matters\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172655205927641088\n@kirisima What would you choose as your film?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172655092245221376\n@creativepockets Why?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172654934346518528\nI just discovered I can view my blog in Timeline view, with a scrolling list of posts organized by month, going back 5 years https://t.co/xD1oGHRCdt\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172635937290907648\n@ClayNichols Might be too niche though. Theyâll be the first ones that arenât a part of everyoneâs career path\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172626885504667648\n@creativepockets Content has become a pure commodity. Every day thousands of excellently produced YouTube videos get published on every topic. So coaching canât be about delivering content anymore, it has to move more toward accountability\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172626741757501440\n@kirisima Even in documentary form?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172626513851641856\n@ryanckulp Whyâs that?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172626443001454592\n@iamrphy True, but mostly itâs ppl spending their own money. Didnât think there was that much interest in PM\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172626250961014784\n@heylukegibson Interesting\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172625007207305216\n@daysofwaves Why?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172624936239681537\n@Mappletons Whyâs that?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172624898532839424\n@jdunck I read about it in The Spirited Child book\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172587370207752195\n@codexseraphin Totally\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172586610879156224\n@MazeDaMouth I mean doing nothing in life, which is what the fear of being perceived as an asshole often leads to\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172583292786204672\n@MazeDaMouth Doing nothing is worse than either\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172575799435640832\n@nateliason Yeah definitely! I think I was partly inspired by yours\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172575598830448640\n@hvasquez Yes I know itâs one of the last bastions of affordability, which is why I think we can find a warehouse\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172575531310542848\n@rovingclint @iam100rabhs Good!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172575023720124416\n@dmcdougall True\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172574896280309761\n@malcolmtorino Good job\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172574628713156608\n@JeremieRykner Why not? We can make things that are utterly unhuman\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172574279721865216\n@NKoachIN Yes basically\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172573864473182208\n@Imperfecting_It Yeah you never wanna go all asshole\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172570521235423234\n@AnthonyBaker I donât think so. Well live nearby\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172569987669643264\n@MazeDaMouth Yes also true\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172569927221276673\n@DrFrankBuck Nope\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172569718789558272\n@kirisima Yeah thatâs huge. Coaching without teeth is suggesting\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172362144706256897\n@JimmyRis Very cool. I think I would do this in the Bay Area\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172361426402328576\n@danielkmezam Secondary I think\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172311757538217985\n@TomLisankie Yes especially\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172311579666210816\n@robertskmiles Donât knock it till youâve tried it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172311511156457473\n@iam100rabhs It takes training and dedication\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172311367715414019\n@danielkmezam Yes, but thatâs âaccess dateâ not âdate updated.â Often something gets accessed often BECAUSE it doesnât change\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172304940699549696\n@biiishal I try to be equal opportunity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172302152661786624\n@maxholzheu Depends on how much effort it takes to make the other ones meaningful. If it takes you a ton of effort to apply tags for example, itâs better to default to date created\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172301794279485440\n@biiishal If youâre never bad, you canât truly be good\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172296763597656065\n@Aboundlessworld Havenât tried it but itâs a good idea\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172294867533234176\n@NarenDhyani What is rare is precious\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172282403731017728\n@dj_bowers That would be pretty confusing though. Too subtle\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172275299968520193\n@atthatmatt Yeah hard to compete with free\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172274133062864896\n@atthatmatt Itâs twice as useful but requires 10 times more effort to keep track of at least. So net ROI on attention is less\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172272420968914950\n@davidoudiette Yes that too\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172262726426664960\n@Brad_Williamson Itâs not that itâs bad. Itâs that the framing has been completely changed and vastly improved by working with some of the best in the biz\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172248591471140866\n@atthatmatt When a platform was so dominant that being on it was non-negotiable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172208163426168832\n@buster Speed was never important in the publishing process, so I think there's a lot of bureaucracy and delay in every little step. But speed is now paramount, not just if you're writing about tech but for everything, since the zeitgeist evolves so much more quickly\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172198447044128768\n@buster It should be faster. There's no inherent reason for it to take that long, besides the legacy structure of the industry\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172186789156552705\n@chriswaterguy That's the secret\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172186290659291137\n@SwamiDaveSays Because I thought building sounded better, whereas build is a little abrupt. Also to echo the gerund in GETTING things done\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172185658309218304\n@Brad_Williamson I wrote a full-size manuscript assembled out of blog posts, but then decided to go the traditional publishing route, and after consulting with an experienced editor and working for months on a formal proposal, it's clear I will need to write the whole thing again ð\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172184377544957952\n@clayhebert Looking forward to it! Itâs so needed\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172002584216817664\n@AnthonyBaker I wrote a long post about it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172002022670782469\nThe widget feature on iOS and notification drawer on Android provide a way to add or search for notes without having to open the app, or even unlocking the phone. iOS instructions: https://t.co/M0rdXuIf0E https://t.co/B8hwZrJRJy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171994544302247936\n@davidjoelhall Cool. Iâm looking for ways that are faster or easier than opening a notes app and typing though\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171993026882764802\n@HuanWin @NateHB13 Oh neat. Is this available on iOS lock screen?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171971909400944640\n@garybasin @Malcolm_Ocean Iâll do my best but probably toward the back of the book, not the cover\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171966880883458048\n@garybasin I know right. But thereâs simply no word like it. Well, system or process is pretty close but not very subtitle-friendly. The Life-Changing MAGIC of Tidying Up though itâs clearly a process\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956944854118400\n@Mattrud Thatâs accurate but seems like such a leap: how to turn your worst problem into your best friend\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956490917183488\n@garybasin Iâve been trying idea management. Itâs better than knowledge mgmt but still not something that is immediately clear\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956284087603201\n@Malcolm_Ocean @garybasin Thatâs a good idea. Challenge is that itâs quite a long journey from raw ideas to concrete results. If I focus too much on former it feels vague. Too much on latter it doesnât explain how\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171955868918669312\n@garybasin Well thatâs not the driving concern but itâs a reflection of how people evaluate new things â connecting it to what they already know\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171955215236382720\n@glenlubbert Yeah no problem itâs a great idea\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171939676665466881\n@GeorgesJanin Iâm collecting notes for a post on why MÃ©xico City is the best remote work city. Iâd quote you\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171931348832882689\n@AnthonyBaker Yes, it's lost in the sands of time. Though I do have my class assignments from high school\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171907126802837506\n@kirisima Lol\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171884687788101633\n@GeorgesJanin Have you written more about this anywhere?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171842951984496642\n@nollindwhachell You really need to blog this stuff. Twitter isnât the right medium\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171842104584130560\n@_SimonLau @otter_ai Very interesting. Itâs hard to imagine accurate transcription on a phone with ppl spread throughout a room though\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171841968348876801\n@_SimonLau @otter_ai How would you do collaborative highlighting during the meeting? Doesn't that require reviewing the transcript afterwards and adding highlights?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171835019259604993\n@nollindwhachell Very cool\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171829932650926080\n@_SimonLau @otter_ai ah ok but it's still you manually adding highlights right?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171829697597980672\n@miniver @agenda Screenshots?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171639723351101440\n@CalmAchiever @braintoss @evernote So IFTTT for tasks, Evernote for notes?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171639510611841024\n@CalmAchiever @braintoss Why have both? How much faster is IFTTT than Evernote?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171639388964450304\n@rishisb @gtdguy Whatâs the advantage over a notes app?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171628408175906816\n@_SimonLau @otter_ai What do you mean the mini summary? As init summarizes the main points for you?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171628323752923136\n@Clayton_Dorge Hard to imagine how it could be faster than the few seconds needed for a notes app\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171627896244297728\n@iam100rabhs @pratul_bagri Not in WhatsApp. You can do that via normal SMS but you donât get extra features\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171627501103149056\n@iam100rabhs Yeah thatâs pretty neat\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171627141340880896\n@rishisb No what is it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171594830113206275\n@AnthonyBaker What does that do?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171576632949084161\n@ianwcrosby @patrickc @cjc @stripe @Bench Does it have the same benefits as one of the points-heavy cards like Chase Sapphire Reserve? Iâd love to switch but thereâs so many benefits\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171571320670191616\n@0xCMP Screen capture?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171565393229385730\n@mauromarinello Can you share a screenshot of using the widget?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171558285742231553\n@DocAyomide @1writerapp Great example\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171557762251149312\n@mauromarinello How is that faster than opening a notes app and typing?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171550557699334146\n@kevindstevens @villageglobal Great to hear. Keep up the good work!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171513982634430464\nI'm getting really excited for the next edition of The Creative Process Workshop, in downtown LA on 9/19. On the surface it's about writing, but really it's about what creativity means and looks like in an age of both abundance &amp; information overload https://t.co/fKS9BYcvJr\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171472359972196352\n@NKoachIN @NotionHQ @trello No Iâm selling my digital nomad lifestyle here in Mex City\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171439502880985090\n@nbarreto I had to have a system that reliably put out quality writing before even thinking about monetization. Once youâre charging people youâre really on the hook\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171438618637811712\n@nbarreto No monetization came much later, almost as an accident\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171438477897895936\n@TomLisankie Yeah I should have said 60 and 80, but ppl usually use a 10 point scale for attractiveness\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171270928220557312\nHow close are you in attractiveness to what you consider the ideal attractiveness for happiness in life? On a scale of 0-100. So if I think Iâm a 6 (or an 8) and ideal is 7, then Iâm 10 points away\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171267962134654982\n@vishalchandra That would fall under specialized apps\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171267229234552832\nLooking back, word processing created new kinds of work rather than eliminating the need to work, and coexisted alongside other kinds of writing rather than replacing them wholesale https://t.co/BJdxvhmkrC\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171257422855299072\nWord processing has been both dematerialized and commodified into an old fashioned, self-conscious activity that we evoke under very specific circumstances. But itâs also now ubiquitous, something we do all the time and everywhere across so many platforms https://t.co/GJg0HE5FIR\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171256184470298624\n@rolfvb Yes that is the juggernaut. The ability to send ppl a direct message straight to their most sensitive channel is absolutely irreplaceable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171220589530341376\n@v350f Cool. Saved for later reading\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171181886212730880\n@Caleb_Allen oh yeah\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171165415570984960\n@LapsusLima SÃ³ podia ser!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171133187155738630\n@Rationalbot Your book would be Patronizing Stereotypes: How to Somehow Appear Both Ignorant and Arrogant at the Same Time\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171104609265258503\nInteresting to read this, when over the last 10 years Word has definitely ceased to be the end all be all software for writing. Probably still the market leader, but only one option among many https://t.co/wlfRVutL5A\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171103656269058049\nWord has definitely received itâs fair share of criticism of course. Among them, that in fulfilling the vision of word processing, it enshrined the document as the privileged artifact, instead of the text itself, which can get obscured https://t.co/nGODvSdjjy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171102815919333376\nJust 10 years after all these incompatible and divergent products, by 1994 Microsoft Word dominated 90% of the word processing market, after winning the âword warsâ https://t.co/J3oKsw5W4g\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171101511151169536\nBarry thus recreated the worn, heavily marked up manuscripts of the pre-digital era, via a carefully engineered effect accessible around the world https://t.co/vBtbiyGbvT\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171098531513417730\nAustralian author Max Barry wrote his book Machine Man one page at a time, posting them online and getting feedback.

Helps you see and appreciate the world in new ways\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171077398177230848\n@m_ashcroft Yes itâs coming. A lot of it is skill and experience too, knowing how to get the cut sooner\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171060439037415424\n@FaddisZach Great questions. Iâm not sure there are definitive answers. They are probably treated as part of the estate\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171053350911131648\n@marcoIunico Better for nighttime reading\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171053201988173824\n@DevDistracted Ah ok thatâs why. Wrong timescale\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171052986849734657\nThe earliest of Salman Rushdieâs museum computers is a Mac Performa (my first computer at the age of 10!), which exists as a complete virtual emulation for people to browse https://t.co/cX6vrmo4va\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170907839222689792\nConceptual artists have explored the internal logic (&amp; inconsistencies) of word processing programs, such as this one by Matthew Fuller that deconstructs the famously complex Word interface https://t.co/JzasZX6N9j\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170902809115582464\nMany modern authors experiment with technology in interesting ways, writing within publishing software, co-crediting designers, crowdsourcing books, and writing in the form of picto-graphs for ex https://t.co/DzODoS8utr\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170900111792230400\nWhereas MacWrite fell short with serious writers, MacPaint made immediate headway with graphic designers, due to its bitmapped screen and custom fonts, inspired by Steve Jobsâ dropping in on a calligraphy class in college https://t.co/sXPOZ6Ogyj\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170896393113952257\nAnd writing itself changed, possibly becoming more verbose, more elaborated, more voluminous, but also more refined, more iterated upon https://t.co/LTjMOUrzZO\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170891207918194689\n@yelvington I think youâre right. It has people switching constantly between writing and editing modes (and research, and visual design, and layout, etc) rather than focusing on getting into flow\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170750133983744001\n@_MRogers @Hyper No I decided I donât really need a laptop battery. iPhone one is enough\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170749819041865730\n@yelvington You mean, a different program should be used for TOC and footnotes than for the writing itself?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170748535039561729\n@adam_keesling No I want it to be public, but not necessarily pushed to every person who follows me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170740150915276802\n@truthjeet Hm maybe Iâll switch to a blog post now\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170736852892082177\n@vgr Ah interesting.

Hard to imagine\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170708305829867520\n@impcapital @dmongan Yeah thatâs the issue. The price you pay for highly specialized tools is they are 1-2 generations behind. Iâd recommend Evernote for you\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170177526838120448\n@kkirkpatrick Way overkill for me\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170134978929319936\n@KeeganLarson Not if itâs limited to only resources. Having project notes mixed in there would be a disaster\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170134767981010955\n@DrFrankBuck Wow! Canât imagine blogging that long\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170134193126424578\n@harmonylion1 @uprtcl @visakanv @lsanger @vgr Whatâs the benefit of this?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170134098695917569\n@baheavey Only the Resources stack within PARA. The others really benefit from spatial organization\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169664739015720960\n@BillSeitz Then why did these tech savvy ppl use such a hacked together system?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169663711444758528\n@danielkmezam I think intensity plus a mixture of fiction and persuasion\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169657169907613696\n@DocAyomide 21,500\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169603490328371200\n@luke_dawgfan Nice\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169477688408428545\nIn the early days there was an explosion of different word processor software, all with different feature sets and not compatible with each other. Hard to imagine in a world dominated by MS Word https://t.co/eMgJzL6d7O\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169455420424912896\n@PracticalStoic Iâm not a fan of spaced repetition. Too much work\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169358110105853952\n@kaizengods Iâve never heard of such a thing. Iâd need to see some pretty awesome content\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169357820602417152\n@marcjouve Thatâs what I thought.

If I don't invest some of myself in it upon initial formulation, it has no chance of succeeding anyway\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169287829421092864\n@joelreymont When the time is right\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1169287699942916096\n@dougvk Oh awesome.

A book on editing I just bought for ex cost $36 for an ebook\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168532772857626626\n@davidklaing Thatâs a dumb example.

It can be average, mediocre\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166788863962099712\n@CmdrDats @RobStuttaford Yes but you need somewhere to put the pile\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166776040305246208\n@CmdrDats @RobStuttaford The issue is you need added capacity just to have the space to think about and re-engineer those things. Like how the first step to organizing a messy room is removing stuff from the room (into an extra space) so you have space to work\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166771087926943744\n@tlaboutka Where Singapore?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166716639720570880\n@DevDistracted She was so convincing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166716325672054786\n@p_millerd Oh thanks\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166533629041926144\n@TamarUghhh Which one?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166504978204094465\n@JimmyRis So many\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166469390331547648\n@lisadimona @joshhanagarne Amazing, thank you\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166421135056982016\n@iamrphy LOL didn't mean to subtweet you like that...but yeah I just complete it then\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166398337068617728\n@jessamyn @ChrisVermilion ah yes of course\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166398058839429120\n@hkgnp I don't know yet.

Releasing trauma through breathwork and anger work\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166215275424796673\n@jonnym1ller @glideapps Huge potential here. It needs to be taught and popularized though\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166210436976369665\n@jonnym1ller Great idea. Iâd love to create a productivity breath\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166207673420767234\n@tejus_sawjiani Ah yes\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166207536392884224\n@jonnym1ller Yes me too. AOL is a network of workshops taught around the world focused on breathing\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166207283304353794\n@jonnym1ller Thatâs very similar to what Art of Living teaches\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166203160022540289\n@tejus_sawjiani Is that a city?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166202132501954560\n@TomLisankie @BillSeitz @vgr Thatâs the least authentic\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166201765345161216\n@VincentBarr Oh nice.

The entire knowledge acquisition process\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166035456200327171\n@nicknaraghi Ooh I like that\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166025869665566720\n@_jacksmith Because the Intellectual Elite TM have declared them unworthy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165824206799392769\n@chandra1250 Yeah heâs great\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165819459937816576\n@garybasin But in a way itâs LESS subjective, recognizing the concreteness of ideas\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165808030484549632\n@mtraven @Meaningness Perfect\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165803305374646272\n@stubborncurias Thatâs good too\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165794147241840640\n@Conaw Seriously?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165794092787175424\n@mk270 I think this might be the closest\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165791993957470208\n@BillSeitz @galtenberg These are things you can do once you have this mindset. But what is the mindset?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165791168845598720\n@davidoudiette That's part of it. But almost a side effect. In a way, ideas get less reified when they are more concrete and interchangeable\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165742362632609792\n@chophshiy That's good. Like evolutionary fitness, but for ideas. But what is the thing that makes that work? Something like \"genes are discrete, durable, and interact in reliable ways.\" That, but for ideas\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165742182726324224\n@vgr That seems right, but it seems like there should be a term for this mindset since not everyone shares it. Something like \"composability\" but for ideas instead of code\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741847827927041\n@galtenberg Reality Hunger is a great word for it. But there's still something more basic than this process. The perspective that must exist in the first place â that ideas are concrete things\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741176730923008\nAny help @vgr? I think I learned this from you\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722708811948033\n@john_c_palmer No it's something more like an attitude, orientation, philosophy, or even ideology, not just a step\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722520496082944\n@vgr This is great. It sounds very similar to how I use Evernote, and why I don't miss fancy features: build up rich nodes asynchronously/serendipitously over time, and then assemble them together just-in-time, right at moment of synthesis/creation\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165719976101195776\n@then_there_was Itâs the sunk cost fallacy turned in your favor. Oh well Iâve already created this folder, might as well fill it with stuff...\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165637928304824320\n@then_there_was Lol yes weâve all been there\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165636424508424192\n@danieldekay Yes, I donât make the rules\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165437702688231425\n@Its_itz_ Itâs only a couple hours, not so bad as a wage I donât think. I guess they have to do the return trip for free though\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165401616431771648\n@galtenberg I think a lot of that can be done as a manager though. I know it can for my work which I consider of similar complexity\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165401432821915648\n@khemaridh Perfect\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165397706904391681\n@gwbaker Hm I think I need some guidelines or reading on how to think about that. Donât know what it means to have a tone in photos.

Iâd love an intro\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165125461627658240\n@mgentry81 Hm interesting. Personal recommendation?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165124566043115521\n@akirathedon But youâre a wavelord\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165069664054964224\n@VincentBarr Yes, like downvoted comments on Reddit\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165069525307379712\n@bierlingm Another contender: https://t.co/kDKkRUYBmh\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165067029193216000\n@JoelGoyette But thatâs my style!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165062786319151104\n@davidklaing @posobin Good ones\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165051230831304704\n@m0Tweets Whatâs a refresh reminder?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165049900058345472\n@YoFolyo Interesting question. Depends on what better means. I like it more since I donât have to rehash material. But it also means it can be hard to move into new domains\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165031663773966336\n@GLuft3 No, but itâd work fine\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165031371149963264\n@staticsteven No Iâm not an early adopter\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165031308147351552\n@mesaulosoares No, thereâs an average level of commitment. And it doesnât have to be exact\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165015328444665856\n@Leonlinsx @khemaridh The first 80% is learning to drive. The last 20% is buying a Ferrari\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164960474057719808\n@iamrphy Well yes. Every checklist is different. But involve researching, reviewing, transferring, converting, notifying, publishing, cross-publishing, etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164884510489530368\n@LindseyHonari Howâd you do that? Physical spaces are harder due to constraints\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164881292791468032\n@iamrphy Theyâre just simple checklists to ensure we do things the same way\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164739024663146497\n@TomFrankly Very cool combo\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164682591783407618\n@Chiliandgarlic Yes it's been around for awhile\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164682362631778305\n@bierlingm @basecamp Why?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164682268989804544\n@TomFrankly Those are good reasons\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164679855541121024\n@AvalancheJohn yeah\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164643477746880512\n@mariepoulin @MightyNetworks It would be premature optimization. Once I go to such a tool the content is crystallized, impossible to change\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164366901402693632\n@mariepoulin @MightyNetworks I insist on it! https://t.co/PWAhMQiQmn\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164365394263457792\n@mariepoulin @MightyNetworks Yes it is. But it makes exceptions meaningful, so itâs useful\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164365209948917760\n@mariepoulin @MightyNetworks I know. I depend on ppl like you to integrate it\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164365084732219392\n@mariepoulin @MightyNetworks I donât like integrated tools\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164363954107195393\n@nollindwhachell Were developing a format and directory for local Second Brain meetups, self organized and self run. You willing to look over s draft proposal?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164363857436925952\n@jakanislupus Iâd tip you 15% for this observation\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164346198305562624\n@jakanislupus Why don't you?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1164305025918615553\n@dougvk Yeah Iâve started reading it.

One reason I created a guide to MS OneNote and use it in my corporate trainings\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163844837721776135\n@KyleAPennell Curiosity is the self-replenishing resource, since it grows the more you use it. The trades are trades in information, knowledge, wisdom, delayed gratification, decisions. Basically ways in which your past and future selves interact, either benefitting or screwing over each other\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163808071258296321\n@KyleAPennell I need to see the context\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163804696726736896\n@ravcchaudhary Almost anyone you ask to explain what they do\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163804584592019456\n@m_ashcroft Awesome thank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163506999893643264\n@chance_blog thank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163473500301955072\nHave you ever spent more than $100 (USD equivalent) on an online product of any kind?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163454074622103553\n@AnkurRSharma Those are good reasons\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163328463605911553\n@CantHardyWait I wouldnât actually guarantee the lease. Itâd be an introduction and recommendation to the landlord, and risk would be up to them. Risk of staying in someoneâs house with them is actually very high\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163264039570427904\n@clayhebert Iâd love to. Happy to help with whatever you need. Starting with intensive live formats is the right way to go\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163263764596084737\n@jeffdeecee I just want a link with a login form and bidding feature. Donât want to deal with eBay bureaucracy\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163261094959312897\n@CantHardyWait Same way as for Airbnb rentals, eBay auctions, or escrow. Seems actually low risk compared to those things\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163260767723872256\nAny other good models for how to support local meetups in a decentralized way? \n\nWeâre going to be creating a directory and support page for Second Brain meetups https://t.co/fm9aU5e7Da\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163260520922660864\n@_jacksmith @Hyper Does it work well?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163255370212495360\n@vgr Specifically, I think thereâs something in German culture that doesnât fit things automatically into good vs evil, like US does. Likes to question them, reverse them, complexity them\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163091356488589313\n@garybasin I will now\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162841174350159872\n@thinkbinge It seems worse than all those, because meanings can be actually contradictory. A hedge is a useful thing but this word is straight up misused\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162841102396928002\n@maxholzheu Why color blindness?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162752592512016384\n@hyperindexed @Conaw Yes, deliverables are designed to be accessible to anyone and last a long time. Notes arenât\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162512156912320512\n@RyFraz @ArrivedHomes For #1, I think the YC label is actually a detriment. Ppl donât buy homes from startups\n\nFor #2, itâd be really hard to build up that kind of supply.

Another version of that is becoming disembodied, totally detached from physical reality which is also no fun\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162127303624802304\n@commandodev Arenât all principles inherently fundamental, and all habits consistent ?\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162123821740171266\n@nollindwhachell @BarrettValues Thatâs pretty neat. Yeah this is like a bottom up, completely practical path to spiritual development. I canât stand philosophy unmoored from reality, so this is my version I guess\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162123654043447296\n@alemeirelles But it's also about giving up control\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162108606361350144\n@DevDistracted Also true\nhttps://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162098292857159681\n@mosedesmoulins When it's there, it's really there.

And actually, the confidence is likely a bit overstated, since there'll be within-user correlations of samples.

I'm curious about approaches which maintain object permanence. Most approaches, incl Roam's, are heavy on \"switching the primary focus\" as a core operation. I  want to see more unusual ideas! Most attempts here are so boring. Here's a weird prototype: https://t.co/nX9OOJ9c1h\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202670186299420672\n@context_ing @productite Hilariously, it's actually the Kindle app: their interfaces differences are meaningless! No experimentation is allowed in the ebook space, grump grump, etc\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202668393452556288\n@wcrichton Yep, they strike me as a good example. A bit narrowâyou can't really fit \"a whole note\" in that design patternâbut good for many types of things!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202665974790381569\nWhat are the best examples and design patterns of peripheral vision in software interfaces?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663259536408577\nIf I read an old digital note, I get the unnerving sense that itâs part of some âwholeâ that I canât see at allâno matter how much hypertext is involved. Working with physical notes, Iâd shuffle notes around to make sense of the structure. There isnât a digital equivalent.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663258827542529\nBacklinks are a weak peripheral vision, and they help, but theyâre generally about switching the one note you have open, not an effective means of sense-making across many notes. Contextual backlinks help, but if you navigate, you lose object permanence.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663258131353601\nMost systems barely support multiple windows, but even if I can open multiple windows, itâs awkward to arrange them into the spatial relationships I might naturally use for physical index cards. Rather than peripheral vision, itâs like Iâm wearing horse blinders and mittens. https://t.co/1akRdeFfv2\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663256143187968\nIn digital note systems, the UI centers on the experience of writing one note. The core operations and representations fixate on âthe note you have open,â not on larger structures. I often canât simultaneously see another note Iâve just finished writingâlet alone the last four.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663245426749440\nThe primary âunitâ in such systems is a single highlight or note, but thatâs not how I think. Marginalia have fuzzy boundaries, and I often think of a pageâs markings as a single unit.\n\nLiquidText is a lovely counterexample: it works hard to display annotations in context. https://t.co/A5rz26mppH\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663243023560704\nPeripheral vision offers context.\n\nIf I mark up a physical book then later flip through to see my margin notes, Iâll always see them in the context of the surrounding text. By contrast, digital annotation listings usually display only the text I highlighted, removed from context. https://t.co/OLlkjLpipe\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663218553868288\nIf I leave books lying on my coffee table, Iâll naturally notice them at receptive moments. I'll read a book if I feel an actual, concrete interest in it. By contrast, the motivation to read a digital book comes from abstract interest in the habit of reading.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663213034196993\nPeripheral vision emphasizes the concrete.\n\nUnread digital books and papers live in some folder or app, invisible until I decide that âitâs reading time.â But that confuses cause and effect. https://t.co/3iHuLIEZYq\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663211817783296\nPeripheral vision spontaneously prompts action.\n\nIf I need to fix a door, Iâll be reminded each time I see it. Digital task lists live in a dedicated app. I have no natural cause to look at that app regularly, so I need to establish a new habit to explicitly review my task list.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663208059691009\nSoftware interfaces undervalue peripheral vision! (a thread)\n\nMy physical space is full of subtle cues. Books I read or bought most recently are lying out. Papers are lying in stacks on my desk, roughly arranged by their relationships. https://t.co/ee7lo0mdLv\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663202997170176\nA delightful way to visualize experimental data on subjects' long-term verbatim recall of prose passages.\n\nRubin, D. C. (1977). Very long-term memory for prose and verse.

If you saw that regularly over months, would you identify with that space more deeply?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584308475092992\nThatâs all indirect: changing identity by memorizing details associated with that identity. But maybe you can use these systems to alter your identity more directly.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584307552342018\nSome questions I'll see for the 20th time and answer by rote, with no emotional connection at all to the original source. Other times Iâll find myself wondering new questions about the topic, feeling gradually more âin contact withâ that topic over time.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584306608648193\nWith spaced repetition, youâre not just \"a person who read that essay that one time\": the repeated engagement may make you feel you're a âstudent of that topic,â in some more continuous sense. The tail might wag the dog.\n\nI'll confess that my own experiences here are mixed.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584305694220290\nLikewise, spaced-repetition helps people remember concrete material, but it also triggers re-engagement across time. Great: maybe readers will spot new connections when they return after a few weeks.\n\nBut maybe that repetition also fosters a change in identity!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584304716963840\nA typical example of a catechism:\nQ1: What is the chief end of man?\nA1: Manâs chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him for ever.\n\nAt the surface, catechisms are about memorizing doctrine. But they also effect a change in *identity* through repeated exposure.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584302179401728\nIn a recent chat with @michael_nielsen and me about https://t.co/lnd5Z3zN1g, @delong suggested that the mnemonic medium is a new kind of catechism. We laughed, butâ¦ that's a pretty interesting lens!

It's easy to imagine increasing their value by e.g. using vector embeddings to \"fuzz\" the edges of that set. Not clear how soon that would come up on an oracular pri-queue relative to design work.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199751318312607745\n@DavidSHolz @jasoncbenn @tayroga @JvNixon @jeremyhoward My instinct is unfashionable: rather than worrying so much about ranking and algorithms, worry a lot about info arch and presentation so you can approximate âsee everything all the timeâ. The challenge is to do that usefullyâeveryone just starts drawing force-directed graphs.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199731427295678465\n@wayfarerish Not yet. Itâs funny; Iâm not sure which direction Iâd want the sign to be. Iâm actually more interested in âweirdâ connections much of the time!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199503853198036992\n@DavidSHolz It's fuzzy. Backlinks themselves are one piece of what I think of as \"peripheral vision\"âserendipitous representations of structure and associations. A high rank tells me that a note is implicitly \"near\" another note that's important along some axis (not always the axis I want).\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199401342160138241\n@itsarnavb Ah, that's interesting. Concretely, how do you express the relevance of a backlink in the editing experience?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199394617491251200\nThis morning I implemented PageRank to sort backlinks in my prototype note system. Mixed results!\n\nï¼: Easier to navigate to implicit \"neighbor\" notes connected via \"hub\" notes\nï¼: Surprises me notice how \"central\" some notes are\nï¼: \"Weird\" backlinks often end up at the bottom\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199378287555829760\n@farrarscott Yeah, I mean, to some extent that's e.g. https://t.co/nF8VOcKM53 and sites like this. Try resizing the browser all the way from desktop-monitor down to mobile. Even the figures adaptâ¦\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198630760523022339\n(Speaking of page numbers, most of them will renumber all the pages if you resize the window, even if the EPUB includes a canonical page mapping! The software situation is so poor that I convert ebooks to PDFânot to improve the layout, but to get *slightly* better reading tools!)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269613357715456\n(For that matter, there seems to be no serious desktop EPUB viewer of any kind. Set aside @patrickc-style dreams of doing anything interesting: none even lets you store annotations in some accessible format, view more than one (non-neighbor) page at once, or link to a page)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269612707569664\nWith effort, you can download the book as a parallel EPUB and PDF (representing the two formats), then but you lose the ability to switch back and forth.\n\nEPUB 3 includes \"multiple renditions,\" which would let you combine both in one fileâ¦ but no viewer supports this 2015 spec.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269612002955264\nIt's nice to use the typical ebook \"flowing\" mode when on small devices or when doing book-wide search operations; it's nice to use the original page layout in almost all other cases. Buuuuuut: Google Play's books are only viewable on desktop in a web viewer.

Of course the most important content in a new node is the original insight it contains, marginal to all other notes in the system. So something like this seems only useful at its limit as a bootstrapping mechanism.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190282712264798208\n@dangoor @BearNotesApp I have a little script which adds them to Bear notes automatically.

I was really struck, though, by how enormous a difference it makes to have the backlinks show the *context*. A list of links is pretty impenetrable; a list of *sentences*, though...\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190281973769498624\n@Ben_Reinhardt It's interesting to think about the relevance angle hereâsomething you reference a lot is clearly important to you, even if you haven't written anything on it explicitly. But this is more akin to saying a website is partially implicitly defined by the websites that link to it.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190105365012041734\nThose backlinks provide kindling for writing the \"proper\" content of the node later. Seems important for the system to display the backlinks' *context:* a simple list of backlinks wonât implicitly define a node very effectively. Gotta see the context around the link.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190102758763855873\nI first noticed this watching @Conaw use Roam. As he took notes on our chats, he made certain noun phrases (e.g. my name, named theories) into node links. Those nodes had no content of their own, but after a few days, they developed an implicit definition through the backlinks.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190102758164066304\nKnowledge systems which display contextual backlinks to a node open up an interesting new behavior. You can bootstrap a new node extensionally (rather than intensionally) by simply linking to it from many other nodesâeven before it has any content.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190102757430063106\n@robinsloan Very excited for this; thank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1187762562823098368\n@michael_nielsen Our tour guide suggested the true number was probably closer to 400; in order to avoid paying death benefits, they didnât count any deaths which occurred off-site (e.g. someone collapses from CO poisoning and is taken to hospital, cause of death declared as pneumonia)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1187762157275901959\n@noahlt That strikes me as a need for an imagination booster shot! :)\n\nHowâs this? https://t.co/Wn9Cgc2zdS\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1187451721859108870\n@andy_matuschak A recent obsession of mine! \n\nTwo recs for you: \nhttps://t.co/X7XkSzTiVA \n\nAnd https://t.co/kb6oJaSUUJ\n\nInterestingly, the Hoover Dam was the creation of six companies that merged because none had the budget or talent to do it alone.

I've really struggled with my relationship to design. I've felt enthralled and empowered by its remarkable practices, but also instinctively uneasy that the work I most admire seems subtly \"apart\" from it. https://t.co/z0WTjcfZpo\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1182497787495079936\nIn https://t.co/nF8VOcKM53, @michael_nielsen and I argue that the most powerful tools for thought express deep, novel insights into the underlying subject matter. It's not enough to empathize with usersâthe designer must be able to produce original research in the target domain. https://t.co/4UFRVsAJgu\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1182497781841154049\n@michael_nielsen Modern design practice demands deep engagement with users' context: interviewing, embedding, reading, empathizing. Such a powerful disciplineâ¦ yet it's hard to shake the sense that the people creating profound tools for thought are doing all those thingsâsomehow way more deeply.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1182497776040431617\nâ¦breaking down the wall between authorial exposition and computational representationsâ¦\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1181948565825785856\n@coponder This is totally fascinating, and I hadn'tâthank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1181767148697309184\n@jasoncrawford @michael_nielsen I actually implement this using recurring tasks of a special type in my task tracker; I just bump up/down the interval each time.

I'm afraid the answer is \"by typing lots of CSS and Javascript.\" I haven't found a better approachâinevitably, each project has its own unique design requirements, and those involve making tradeoffs that seemingly can't be represented in a template.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1181248511926423552\n@nikolasklein This is really excellent.

The former are implicit and much more explicit; the latter explicit and require work. Sometimes a straight timeline would be basically the same and way cheaper; other times very differentâ¦\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147932586737459200\n@amyhoy Neat! I look forward to seeing. That latter point does seem to be true more often than I'd like, unfortunately.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147932214354575361\n@joshu Neat! What was the motivation / framing?\n\nI'm not sure I'd want to explicitly order materials (I could do that with files now, I guess, and I don't!)âmore like I want to see something about how these things relate. eg. if it's 30 papers, were 28 of them references I found from 2?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147931736182935552\nAre there any good analyses of the structural reasons why weâre here and not there? Key problems with associative linking as attempted in past large-scale systems, etc? Other interesting attempts besides Xanadu? LiquidText is neat; fun to imagine OS-level adaptationsâ¦ [fin]\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928391435186182\nBush also describes how you could acquire trails from othersâanother notion weâre missing. Othersâ trails could be applied to materials you already have, so you could see a colleagueâs associative structures alongside your own, on the same files.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928390826991616\nBut tags and folders are just sets. The structure is unordered, but your associations usually arenât. Itâs not just a theoretical problem: tags/folders are jumbled messes after a couple dozen items. Probably certain files are higher âdegree,â but youâll never know.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928390113955840\nOS-level tags solve a problem Bush observes: that indexing systems usually assume thereâs a âbestâ categorization of an item, but they often have many associations. You want many-to-many. But tagging a 100-page PDF or a 100-comp PSD isnât very helpful. Memex links are page-level!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928389468053505\nIf you want to arrange your own works relative to a disparate collection of othersâ works, modern OSes offer folders and tags instead of links. In many cases, these are better: many associations form a clique or a tree, not a trail as Bush emphasizes.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928388851490816\nBush also suggested that this web of links wouldnât just be between othersâ published worksâthat subordinates your own work to othersâ. Your own materials (drawings, drafts, voice recordings, etc) are also stops on the associative âtrail.â\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928388272709632\nAnd of course, even thatâs just the web. What about associations between pages of an ebook and a paragraph of a PDF? Between an email from a colleague and some drawings it reminded me of?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928387698081792\nBushâs associations are bidirectional, while web links are one-way. I suspect bidirectional links make much more sense in a personal context than in contexts where all links must be shared by all; that may be part of why the webâs have stayed unidirectional.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928387152838657\nSome people think this observation means Bush predicted the wiki. Yes, on a wiki, you can add a link to the text yourselfâ¦ but that link would appear for _everyone._ Thereâs no notion of _personal_ associative markup.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928386091618304\nBush recognized that we think associatively. He thought weâd amplify creative work by building and navigating associative trails across materials. Many see this as predicting the WWW, but on a web site, you can only consume the links the author put there; you canât add your own.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928385420554240\nWhen I first read As We May Think* as a teenager, I was astonished by how much it predicted of the computer age in 1945âbut recently Iâve been feeling wistful about some pieces it predicts which never came to pass.

Feels a little more distant from the problem than writing, which can be helpful.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390837542084609\nJust being bored, sitting somewhere, can be comparatively quite generative: helpful thoughts might arise which would feel too off-topic to pursue otherwise! Or I might just end up with a more expansive mental state, to be deployed in one of the other methods.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390836887740416\nLong solo contemplative walks have low stakesâmaybe lower than in conversationâbut can linger somewhat longer on a single thread than might be socially comfortable in a conversation. Itâs easier to just zone out, though, which might or might not be helpful.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390836220846080\nConversation will jump between more threads; itâs rare to focus on one idea for hours. But it may be more generative both because itâs less focused and because it involves others. The stakes for making progress often feel lower than for writingâ¦ which can be either good or bad.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390835616890880\nWriting is fairly directed, good for maintaining a train of thought for long periods. The âscratchpadâ of writing-so-far supports flimsy working memory, allowing more constituent thoughts to be juggled in synthesis. Itâs a bit easy to iterate on something specific.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390834903818245\nOK yes: itâs hard to hear yourself think; writing is a great way to isolate and sharpen ideas. But soâs a long walk, conversation, etc. They all have their own effect, like an EQ on mental noise! Fun to think about steering those vibes. Partial catalog (reply with more!):\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390834304086017\n@natevw Indeed!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140700102547234816\nThatâs just one cognitive medium: thereâs a whole zoo to be created! And of course we can decompose âimpactâ into âemotional resonance,â âdetailed understanding,â âmotivation,â etc, and examine the impact of novel media on those efficient frontiers. (Fin)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684240549343232\nhttps://t.co/lnd5Z3RnSO focuses on higher levels of reader investment, but itâs not difficult to imagine adjusting those mechanisms to make e.g. blog posts more impactful for a fixed level of reader interest.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684239899201537\nIn this sense, thereâs something for everyone. A fixed level of reader investment can yield a bigger impact. A fixed level of desired impact can be had with lower investment. The minimum-viable-investment shifts downwards; the maximum-accessible-impact shifts upwards.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684239282659334\nNew cognitive media can bend these efficient frontiers up for _everyone_, establishing a new baseline. Helping a median reader access the impact curves of an 80th percentile reader. Helping a 99th percentile reader access new curves altogether. https://t.co/ihgYbSVgT8\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684237923704832\nTo some degree, these curves are all personal to each reader: if you learn great study skills and build great discipline, you may be able to bend the whole frontier of some medium upwards for yourself. So, yes, itâs great to teach people how to study, but:\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684237214928896\nDifferent mediums have different frontiers. Film makes that clear: at low levels of âreaderâ investment, that format can consistently deliver so much higher levels of impact than books! But since theyâre necessarily shorter than books, perhaps theyâre harder to study deeply. https://t.co/IoN6d3yjep\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684235134517248\nIf we overlay the best works in a medium, weâll see them approximate an âefficient frontierâ (https://t.co/ESLQ4xcXLQ)âthe limits of that medium's efficacy at a given level of investment. Good writing/editing is in part about trying to get closer to this frontier. https://t.co/NMGN7xQRzS\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684233377058816\nMore academic texts might offer nothing below some level of reader investment yet handsomely reward a week of serious study. Accessibility stretches a text left; depth stretches a text right. More effective texts are shifted upwards, offering more impact at any level. https://t.co/42bGIsECsY\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684231665807360\n(âImpactâ is deliberately vague. Whatâs important might not be detailed understanding; it might be a shift in the way you see the world, or a sense of possibility, or whatever. Just thinking intuitively: how much does it change what the reader thinks, does, can think, can do?)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684230982131713\nI framed the piece in terms of mass-market books to give everyone a common basis, but I see this as a continuum. A quick blog post might demand little reader interest and offer little impact. Mass-market non-fiction might offer more impact for more reader investment. https://t.co/o4DdS1QD4R\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684229119893505\nIn https://t.co/PdABtZsEjY, I argued that non-fiction books are surprisingly ineffective for typical readers. One common (great!) criticism I heard was: Isnât reader interest the biggest factor? So what if vaguely-interested people donât absorb much from pop non-fiction? (Thread)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684228444610561\n@danielchooper @peterhajas @kylemacomber I see! Yes, you can think of it as a sophisticated version of âwhen needed.â A typical immediate mode implementation would not have the same kind of tracking.

(c.f. https://t.co/QPueTFrB3Y)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127785742501998592\n@anikasai @patrickc @michael_nielsen Iâm slowly coming to believe that in many respects, video game designers are far more knowledgeable about design and cognitive science than designers and cognitive scientists are.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127619012462964737\n@Jacob_Zelko @JoyXun1 @wesleysamples @cyborgcharu @emilyjfong Youâre right; the claim is too strong flatly stated. But just on a relative basis, I believe the relationship youâre describing can be made far more vivid and fluid using a richer medium.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127615172942618624\n@danielgross @michael_nielsen Weâre trying to answer that question in another, larger piece. Quick preview of theory: requires inventors who are able to do both original design work and also original cognitive science. Existing institutions and incentive systems make such teams unlikely.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127613971068928002\n@nicklovescode @michael_nielsen https://t.co/Tf4YlEEeZo\n\nNietzsche explains better than I can!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127416222214000640\n@sroussey Iâd love to read more if you published anything about this work!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127403129685692418\n@anikasai @patrickc @michael_nielsen Sometimes itâs hard to disentangle those things! For instance, Principia Mathematica both defines a medium made of logic... and also aspires to shape its usersâ epistemological relationships to truth statements in math. Hard to escape.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127400115386249216\n@alexisgallagher The latter is a favorite but the former is new to me; looking forward to reading! Thank you.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127354972885045252\n@TheAnnaGat If you feel inclined to write up any of your thoughts, Iâd be grateful for themâ\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127354537302343681\n@TheAnnaGat ð Thank you Anna!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127352953457627136\n@impcapital @trengriffin @patrickc While I fear for the typical application, having now experienced edtechâs priorities, Iâm optimistic that this type of biofeedback technology can indeed be put to empowering, non-dystopian use. Is there a white paper?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127346531399417856\n@trengriffin @patrickc That's already been one interesting consequence of https://t.co/lnd5Z3RnSO: we can see exactly which concepts people are struggling to retain. Sometimes it's just that the concept is complex (maybe we need to break it down more); other times it points to a failure on our part!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127338356063391744\n@nsfmc There's a lot of that on HN.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127337407601229824\n@patrickc ðââï¸ Thank you, Patrick!ð\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127336801276796933\n@dannyaroslavski Sort of. Efficacy is multivalent. Empirically, Quantum Country studentsâ retention does indeed increase over time. But yes, thatâs only part of the story. Lots of work to do here.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127322253840883712\n@dannyaroslavski Yes, I think itâs possible to create an environment which scaffolds that skill through expert modeling, sentence starters, social comparison, etc. Would be a fun design project, but not top of my list this moment.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127315731404582912\n@paulvigna @smc90 I'm very aware of the issue! :)\n\nThe ideas described in the final section have mitigated some of the problems for another subject; I look forward to removing this footnote from some future iteration. https://t.co/9x4FAhUcIG\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127275705346093057\nModels of social and emotional learning in action, indeed! https://t.co/6PD5MItJom\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1127271328195596288\nð£ New essay distilling one strand of some ongoing workâ¨\n\nI argue that books lack a functioning model of how people learnâinstead, they're (accidentally, invisibly) built around a model that's plainly false.

Lots of thoughtful design notions there.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1124170045704118272\n**Full thread**\n\nStruck by a market-making provocation from \n@tristanharris\n today: \"Imagine a world where you love how you make choices and you love how you're directing your attention, because tech inventors are competing to figure out how best to help you live as you intend.\"\n\nIt's not clear how to align incentives so that this becomes a relevant design question for tech co's, but I'm enjoying the prompt. It's interesting that OSes have contacts, calendars, docs, etcâyet no representation of anything purposive, of ways of being, of \"what matters?\"\n\nFunny to contrast the ubiquitous to-do app's model with intentions which might deeply matter to someone, like \"I want to make sure I'm taking my ideas as seriously as possible.\" Tasks are such a misleading way of thinking about intention. But hey, it's easier to build a to-do UI!\n@infiniturtle Oh, goodness, that's incredibly kind; thank you! ðââï¸\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1122563322115543040\n@infiniturtle (I left, sry)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1122276466782158848\n@paulnovosad @michael_nielsen I'd love to learn more about your experience! Can you talk me through what's going through your mind when you see a card like this come up in the review session?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1122190585564028928\n@mbirna @edelwax Update: I was fascinated by your group's attempt to systematize this type of reasoning. Have these theories yet been applied or instantiated in any interactive systems? I wasn't able to find any references of that kind, but I may have missed them!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121625626375385088\n@noididntreadit @webdevMason I donât think I can explain in words; has to be experienced. Thatâs part of the whole weird paradox. But as an intuition pump, this is vaguely relevant. https://t.co/biQ4kwFCeD\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121278621719490560\n@andy_matuschak @tristanharris A question I find interesting: would people choose to use a product if they knew in advance that it would cause them to, say, quit their current job and take a different one that was more enjoyable and fulfilling at the cost of a considerable pay cut?\nhttps://twitter.com/webdevMason/status/1121218786453884928\n@webdevMason @tristanharris I love this. To the point I raised in another tweet about meditation, I probably wouldnât have started that if I understood what it really was for. There is an inferential distance problem here. But that framing sure seems awfully patronizing.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121217860284452864\n@webdevMason @tristanharris Itâs such a funny Trojan horse! I myself started meditation years ago because I wanted to âfocus betterâ (ie for my work), and of course, after I became a regular practitioner, I understood how self-defeating that framing was.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121217314987200512\n@fatemehx2 Sure, would be interested to read! Thank you. andy@andymatuschak.org\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121212489100746752\n@webdevMason @tristanharris Indeed, environments can change people in these kinds of ways. If you move to a different city, you'll likely become a different person in some interesting ways. etc etc\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121211775720886272\n@webdevMason @tristanharris One more reflection: I think part of the trouble is talking about what \"people\" \"want\" in any durable sense. People change. We can even support those we love in changing, in endorsing by default the choices they might previously have only endorsed on their best days.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121211726312030209\n@webdevMason @tristanharris Part of what makes this easy for me to imagine is that this story has already happened, for tons of people, through avenues like meditation or CBT.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121211692573020160\n@webdevMason @tristanharris 5. Now Bob's more aware of how he feels when he makes choices he loves vs. those he \"should make\"\n6. Over time, he develops a taste for the former, participates in Tristan's market, which makes him even more self-aware, etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121211662713835520\n@webdevMason @tristanharris 1. Bob hears people talking about a new kind of super-diary, which people say helps them feel more intentional\n2. After the 5th mention, the chatter connects with Bob's prior unease\n3. Bob tries it, *does* become more intentional\n4. Bob's genuinely grateful for this development\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121211568383856640\n@webdevMason @tristanharris I'm often disheartened by the same, but I'll play the optimist here. There is some populationâsure, not everyoneâwho feel an intermittent vague uneasiness about the way they seem to be passengers in their own lives. It is easy for me to imagine good things happening (cont):\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121211531285241856\n@tristanharris I think often of this related closing from https://t.co/3MJu7bD4It https://t.co/kHFiJUjvcv\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121206700969644033\n@lululucywow But I'm prepared to believe that meaningful improvement's possible for, say, most people in G12 countries. I don't really know what most people's barriers are here! e.g. mine include things like \"feeling an inappropriate sense of duty/obligation to things that don't matter\"\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121205716939730944\n@lululucywow Ah, I meant \"influence\" in a positive sense. That is: for what sorts of life situations can consumer products meaningfully help people love the way they make choices? e.g. if you don't love the way you make choices because you're impoverished, there's less an app can do.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121204240301445120\n@mbirna @edelwax Will read; thank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121158840630702080\n@MatManferdini Thanks, will check it out.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121097654950215680\n@Westoncb I've found it useful to do this sort of thing (less formally than you describe) diagnostically. But the tasks can't tell me my \"actual\" intentions; distilling those requires other methods. For me at least, tasks are reactive, not proactive. They represent my shallowest thinking.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121096982796193794\n@shancarter Life coaches are an interesting reference. Certainly people spend lots of money on such services; certainly those services seem to help many people in an outsized way. What are the powerful ideas at play there?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121096055859269632\n@iandanforth @jeffclune It's funny: so much of how I think about this topic is about *rejecting* goal-orientation. Being the way I want to be often means fixating less on goals and more on tastes, values, beliefs, etc. But I take your point; I'm interested in how agents can help in an IA-not-AI sense!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121095844491513856\n@livelyroland @edelwax The power of an interface is bounded by the power of the ideas it reifies. (But it's not one-way: by instantiating ideas in interfaces, we can think some thoughts which we couldn't think prior, which may lead to even better ideas, which can then be reifiedâ¦)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121095128267943937\n@amyskerry Right! Impulses:\n1. Some of that tech *does* work well! Let's have more.\n2. Part of the possibility space may require OS-level support?\n3. Part of the p-space may require (something like) end-user programming?\n4. Maybe only some regions of p-space can capture value it creates?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1121094626230726657\nI wonder for what % of people the key bottlenecks to âloving the way one makes choicesâ can be influenced by consumer products at all. For me, actually, I think they can be! But itâs easy to imagine the issue being, say, family / physical health / money / etc\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1120922566829334528\nFunny to contrast the ubiquitous to-do app's model with intentions which might deeply matter to someone, like \"I want to make sure I'm taking my ideas as seriously as possible.\" Tasks are such a misleading way of thinking about intention.

Thank you, Grant!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1120460843727097856\n@voeliz I donât know, and itâs a real loss. Honestly, one useful answer is: Twitter!

Alas.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1119640919207055361\n@karankurani @michael_nielsen Thank you! You mention that you want to retry the whole set for that reason. How would you feel if we finished review sessions by re-asking you only the questions you missed? Is there a reason you feel you need to redo the whole set, beyond just the ones you missed?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1119296369796112384\n@DamienPetrilli Ah, gotcha. As it stands, we'll send you an email a few days after new essays are released (assuming you're registered). Thank you for the suggestion.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1119285773033848832\n@karankurani @michael_nielsen Thanks for passing that along. When you find yourself wanting to repeat a review session, whatâs going through your head? Are you feeling a particular way?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1119089813972344834\n@karankurani @michael_nielsen Gotcha! Weâll definitely need an undo function, but hopefully we can fix the underlying issue so youâre never having to undo. :)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1119082546409533440\n@karankurani @michael_nielsen That's very helpful, thank you. You mentioned \"scroll up,\" which surprises me a little: the review sessions shouldn't involve any scrolling. Could you let us know what kind of device you were reviewing on?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118954020033318912\n@karankurani @michael_nielsen Thanks, thatâs good to know. Can you say more about the mistapping? Was it that you werenât trying to tap on anythingâjust adjusting your grip, sayâyet a review was triggered? Or that you accidentally tapped â when you meant â?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118932922432491520\n@BalajiSrinivas2 @michael_nielsen Thanks for the kind words. We have no patents or IP claims over the \"mnemonic medium\" notion, so you're totally free to use these ideas however you like. Please do send along anything you make!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118737332201345027\n@DamienPetrilli That's interesting. What would you want the RSS to do?

You should be all set!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118574411978723328\nIt's about beginning to go beyond our everyday classical intuition, and to develop tools and heuristics for thinking about the quantum world.\nhttps://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1118572463749599237\nThe essay isn't just about the search algorithm. It's also about learning to think in the quantum realm. Think of it as an introduction to quantum algorithm design, introducing many techniques which can be used in other algorithms as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1118572454627008512\nThis second essay begins to play out that notion.\n\nOur first essay (https://t.co/ZiXVbbPs1K) introduced QC's basics. Many readers reviewed that essay's concepts 5+ times over the last few weeks; with that growing fluency, we hope they'll find quantum search more accessible.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118572244827926528\nWhen people struggle to learn complex ideas like quantum search, how often is thatâperhaps even invisiblyâbecause they're not fully fluent in the prerequisite concepts? They might \"know\" the prereqs, but only with so much cognitive load / delay that they can't absorb more.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118572244093943808\nð£ New \"mnemonic essay\" on quantum computation with @michael_nielsen ð¨\n\nHow can any procedure possibly search a list in O(âN) time?

Quick take: interesting ideas connecting annotation to synthesis. Doesn't appear to be trying to be a reference library, but that's fine.

Sometimes good, often not what I want. I'm mostly cooking New American food. In that context, clarified butter is useful, and ghee is a convenient pre-clarified butter.

If you buy high-butterfat butter, it's soft even at fridge temp. For spreading on toast or something, I just spread it cold and then top with some crunchy finishing salt.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1114200607634546689\n@tolmasky * Only unsalted (I control salt)\n* Only ingredient is cream (no \"natural flavoring\")\n* If I'm baking: ~82% butterfat\n  - If sweet: sweet cream or mild cultures (Kerrygold, Challenge)\n  - If savory: cultured (PrÃ©sident)\n* If cooking/raw: 84+% butterfat, cultured (Straus, Vermont)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1114198762270875649\n@LamaAlRajih @alexeyguzey Indeed!!

Unfortunately, its UI. Keep It is a nice new alternative, but fairly barebones.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1113886672876257280\nThank you for sharing, all! Reflections:\n\nMany people suggested text-centric note-taking apps for this purpose. The interaction paradigm seems misaligned: I think of this need in terms of ubiquitous capture, seeing, connecting, searching, synthesizing, etc. Feels more like this. https://t.co/9PBIgVZBnq\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1113886671425007616\n@Altimor ohnoelectrondotgif\n\nA few questions if you feel inclined:\n1.

So good.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1112072355797319680\n@dan_abramov @sophiebits @sebmarkbage Regarding order/type changes: what if the tool embedded a flow server?

These are very different problems, and both must be solved to benefit patients. 4/5 https://t.co/R4PBzZ2aBd\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031871347941376\nTranslation suggests unidirectionality. Indeed, the field used to frame itself as \"bench-to-bedside,\" suggesting that the bench produces ideas which the bedside consumes. But they later abandoned that framing, realizing it's a loop: contact with application informs the bench. 3/5 https://t.co/zhaeHYEnwV\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031865677217794\nOne key insight: this translation is *foundationally* interdisciplinary. With increasing specialization, it's often true that neither the relevant scientists nor the relevant clinicians/bioengineers can see a path to application on their own. They can only see together. 2/5\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031865144569857\nHave you heard of the field of translational medicine? I've found it a tremendously helpful analogy for my own work.\n\nThe field focuses specifically on trying to turn basic science discoveries into possible paths for clinical application. This is a useful idea in many fields! 1/5\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031864607674369\n@hecker @michael_nielsen That's very kind, Frankâthank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111024895050153984\n@fet @michael_nielsen Alas, we have a design ready, but it didnât quite make the release timeline.

Thanks for the kind words.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108899691326894080\n@sophiebits Yes, we thought a lot about that. In brief, probably both are helpful. Making cards is itself a skill; that skill is hard to acquire and is metacognitively taxing; like all such skills it is best to scaffold it.

Thank you!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108850993238691841\n@garybernhardt This is much like your Loader superclass solution, but I find I can usually abstract away more boilerplate with a higher-order component.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108845858991177728\n@garybernhardt One approach I have used is to make a single prop as you described, but without the undefined alternative; make a higher-order wrapper, generic over prop type, which renders a loading UI if prop is undefined, or argument component if prop is present.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108845270555475968\n@ben_eater Grateful for the wondering aloud! Just curious: had you wondered this *after* completing your own first review session, or just based on my screenshot out of context? Will help me diagnose the design. :)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108842889306497024\n@michael_nielsen @RDesai01 That's very kind!

I'm not even that interested in quantum computing, but I'm working my way through this.

I have a bunch of sketches trying quite hard to \"invert\" the medium in that wayâto make the cards the primary element, and the prose light or absent. We couldn't make it work (yet).

At least for me, after many thousands of cards, I appear to be nowhere near an upper bound. I add more cards; they get memorized; the curve doesn't change. I suspect we underrate our memory capacity.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108235959949131776\n@nsfmc Wait is that a bug what happened\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108188594944958464\n@backus Thatâs very kind!

A few minutes of study, repeated over about 20 sessions over the next year, and you'll remember everything forever. It feels like cheating. One reader: \"The bang for the buck is extraordinary.\" https://t.co/j2JbYkcmM1\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108069000938872833\nThat's the retrospective effect. The *prospective* effect is a feeling of safety. Once youâve read a few sections, now you read each new passage knowing that youâll have this quick check at the end. It's a save point every few minutes. You're not going to miss anything.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108069000318054400\nOne reader said: \"There was a section where I tanked them all. I thought: wow, I clearly didnât get whatever I was supposed to get. [â¦] So then I went back and asked âwhy am I not retaining this?â Iâve never had that with a textbook before: usually the problems are at the end.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068999730876416\nSomething felt totally mysterious? You just learned that you left the stove on before you left the driveway. It doesnât feel so onerous to read a section again on the spot. It would feel much more tiresome to realize that a few days laterâ¦ so you might not reread the section.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068998879404032\nImagine youâve just finished a tough section. We say: catch your breath; letâs take stock. We quickly flick through what we learned. Got it all? Great, weâll review again later, when you've probably forgotten. Something slipped your mind? OK: weâll review that bit sooner.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068998233489408\nOne reason books are hard is: readers run all the feedback loops. \"Did I really get that? Should I flip back?\" This demands attention to both the content and also the meta.\n\nWe interleave prose and lightweight spaced repetition to take some of that work off the reader's plate. https://t.co/vy7ewONxYh\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068997042298880\nHappily, there's a way to remember anything almost effortlessly: spaced repetition. A few minutes each dayâas much memory as you want. Magic.\n\nBut few people use it. Textbooks don't leverage it. Tools for it desperately lack design. What if we fix it up and build it into a book? https://t.co/808j9XjCsI\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068995859529728\nDoes this feel familiar?\n1. You read a book and feel you understood it.\n2. Next week, you try to answer a question about it.\n3.

What about to the level which reflects reality?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1089223736400568321\nOn a few occasions, I've had the opportunity to help others notice this. It's a startling experience: people react a bit like they were caught talking in their sleep. Others have done this for me a few times, and I'm so grateful.\n\nSee also @tylercowen's https://t.co/OERvPGwbX7.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1089223735750549504\nI'm not even prescribing a normative \"people should be more optimistic\" (though I think that too). What's so striking is that people often undershoot optimism/ambition relative to *their own* held beliefs about what is possible and valuable. They're just using cached thoughts.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1089223735175860224\nSure, this specific advice is not appropriate for everyone, but I love the genre of optimism-generating media. Everyone has some optimism/ambition \"efficient frontier\" (relative to risk tolerance, values, etc); many behave nowhere close. A simple nudge can remind what's possible. https://t.co/3aCnYHObts\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1089223734504828928\n@speculatvglitch A *what*?!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1088598850204364800\nâThe visions we offer our children shape the future.

Lots of relevant \"new theories.\" For me, the key idea is recognizing that the default path for our media operate on known-ineffective theory.

Depends.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1081701662895497222\n@metamitya I should qualify that the \"new theory\" is fractal: lots of intertwined cognitive theories.

Effective learning from a book requires tons of challenging metacognitive workâwhich is why works like How to Read a Book are popular.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1081415543914033152\n@tayroga Lots of valuable ideas, but there's much missing before we can gel the pieces into a general medium for conveying and assimilating knowledge.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1081413793224085504\n@ecgade Its ideas represent a valuable piece of the puzzle. Yet it's just a piece. If we take Logo to be a vessel for differential geometry: if one is interested in learning about that topic, how exactly should one use Logo to pursue it?

Industrial manufacturers already do this (except for the sweetness bitâthey're way too sweet), but the chocolate will be awful. You can make ice cream at home to use really good chocolate, but you need these techniques to match the texture and flavor release of industrial.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075641898218319875\n@MaxTagher No, but because I'm making my own base I can adjust fat, egg, and sugar content appropriately for each flavor, and I can use the heating process to infuse ingredients like coffee. Premade bases are hard to infuse well (can't reheat too hot), and they have fixed component ratios.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075640910384267265\n@MaxTagher One funny reason why homemade can easily be much better than ice cream shops' is that in many states (like CA), if you mass-produce ice cream, you must start from a base made w/ an inspected pasteurization facility. So they all use the same bases from e.g. Strauss and doctor it.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075627590709170176\n@MaxTagher It's much better than what I can buy from an ice cream shop, but not as good as ice cream from serious pastry lines at high-end restaurants. Relative to typical ice cream, mine's:\n- way less sweet\n- higher fat\n- better flavorings: I'll use $$ ingredients; a $10 retail pint can't\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075627080073658369\nI made two batches in the last two weeks following these ideas, and they're both a huge leap better than any ice cream I've made before!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075619443928064001\nI love making ice cream at home, but this series really leveled me up: https://t.co/NY70m9lZhY\n\nThree ideas:\n1. Dextrose + invert sugar to lower sweetness\n2. Milk solids to depress the freezing point and lower water %\n3. Replace most eggs w/ gums to stabilize w/ cleaner flavor\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075619443202379776\n@farrarscott I think it's importantânot so much for memory as much as for understanding: writing good cards requires synthesis, connections.\n\nI suspect it *is* possible to use others' cards (with some penalty in view of above), but most people write poor cards (and don't know itâhard to see).\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075534956921741313\n@gplewis Ah, sorry: flash cards meant for use in a spaced repetition system like Anki or Supermemo. See eg https://t.co/l3wMxHSFzL and https://t.co/yIXBd4hhH0\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075520312249278464\n@farrarscott A more complex category: I just finished a conversation with a person who thinks about the world differently, in a way I find stimulating. What 20 cards can I write? Writing good prompts here requires creativity (though there are some patterns).\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075516192305999873\n@farrarscott Simplest category: 100s or, alas, probably 1000s not written because theyâre things I found striking when reading away from a computer, and I failed to follow up (hard to build that workflow).\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075515793918443520\n@spiralstairs Yeah, totallyâI want the timeline version of that. :D\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075515361489870848\nWho are your favorite accounts to follow in the vicinity of China-focused design culture and practice?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075493485271121920\n@andy_matuschak @ANNELAMOTT One model I like for thinking about such questions: working at the edge of your abilities means your models of yourself start to break down; you're doing something you haven't done before. This is _why_ it can be so hard to make judgement calls between 1, 2 (or something else)\nhttps://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1075491623083986945\nQuite a poetic response to my prompt about work aphorisms. https://t.co/mZFYf1J2Ex\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075488109540720640\nOnce one's attention is on the writing-a-card cost, environment becomes a key barrier. The cost is way higher on a smartphone keyboard, so I make cards on my laptop. But my habits often misalign: I read while out, I read in bed, etcâthe laptop's not around. Gotta \"buffer\" cardsâ¦\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487477803081728\nI think there are ways to mitigate that cost, but some of it's essential: in writing cards, I'm synthesizing, comparing, filtering, personalizing, etc. I'm interested in structures and routines which support me in doing those things more rapidly or with less friction.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487477211648001\nThis leads to a *very* unintuitive feeling: it'sâ¦ effectively free to memorize as many new cards as I can write? What?\n\nWhich in turn means that for me, the real marginal cost is in the moment of *writing* a new card.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487476674834432\nFor instance, often I'll review cards while waiting 10 minutes for the next train. This doesn't \"cost\" me 10m because I would've just been screwing around on Twitter or something. And even with 1000s of cards, it often takes less than 10m! I can't write new ones quickly enough!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487476095963136\nIn spaced repetition, it's tempting to ponder per-card costâ\"should I pay three minutes over my lifetime to memorize this?\"\n\nBut for me, marginal cards are effectively *free* to add:\n1. I review cards in time that'd be dead anyway.\n2. I can't add enough cards to fill that time.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487475563253760\n@nayafia But how do you know how to balance your methodology definition??? It's turtles all the way down~~\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075206472835821569\n@nayafia Nice post; thank you! I also struggle with explore/exploit tradeoffsâ¦ but something about the tension I feel in these statements isn't captured by that dichotomy. For instance: sometimes when I need to explore, \"butt in chair\" really does help!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075203726275530753\nI've found truth in both these aphorisms:\n1. Creative insight is more about noticing and cultivating expansive mental states than it is about #hustleporn. Take a walk.\n2. Screw that: butt. in. chair. \"Stop not writing,\" per @annelamott\n\nTwitter, how do you approach this conflict?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075201401427378176\n@redblobgames I will say this: if you observe people closely enough, there are magicians everywhere. The answer to the question: \"Would I have done that?\" is so often \"No, it would never have occurred to me.\" And, very often, that means there is something to be learned.\nhttps://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1074191588052525056\nSince reading this 6 months ago, I've come to think it's half a dozen of the best paragraphs I've ever read on how to get much, much better at anything: (by @autotrnslucence ) https://t.co/dMoEwHtjfU\nhttps://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1074161071290634240\nHow does one come up with radically new, high impact ideas, and become a senior researcher? I donât have the answer, but I think being more creative helps. I find that this list of questions help me filter out what I should spend my time working on: https://t.co/ENq3fhG7xK\nhttps://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1074160318622748672\nMy friend @Ben_Reinhardt has a new podcast about institutions and systems which foster long-term innovation, and I'm loving it!

Maybe their aggregated respect measure is usefully like a prediction market?

Case studies must focus on showing great work and communicating an approach; reports like this convey a system of ideas, their influences, and their consequences so that others can build on them. https://t.co/MDmapfcRL2\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1072935819223031808\nThere are many thoughtful details in this experimental creative thinking tool from @inkandswitch, but rather than write about those, I wanted to highlight how incredibly valuable (and rare) detailed design reports like this are: https://t.co/OkG2RzXNXn.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1072935818593918976\n@c_callahan45 @lisasimpsonirl @soylentqueen @EnDimensions @gregzoda (this is fascinating; thank you for sharing, y'all!)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1072564315734110210\n@jtaylorhodge @fortelabs Indeed, I actually thought of Tiagoâs work when I saw this!

But maybe if I slow down all the words and listen carefully, these arguments are coherent, compelling, meaning-dense, etc? Maybe my sense of argumentation is broken?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1072353937066520577\nI still don't understand anything that's going on when I watch one of these things, but I'm totally fascinated and impressed!

(Maybe that was what you were suggesting?)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1065435172835913728\n@kevinakwok @devonzuegel Itâs true, but I feel design systems (as the term is typically used in current trends) are pretty close to the surface in terms of depth-of-design-thinking. I wonder how to build systems which support pushing deeper in OSS.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1065434952282619904\n@devonzuegel Design requires holistic, auteur-like thinking, which doesnât fit well into incremental participation models of the open source world.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1065425673827885056\nAside from the fascinating treatment of this important topic, I particularly enjoyed the survey methodology: pairwise ranking of examples is a great way to find order when cardinal ranking is hard. https://t.co/tJdIK14TyR\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1063461032767688705\nhttps://t.co/Bhniva71Zu\nhttps://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1062201240656896001\n@EnDimensions In this sense! https://t.co/8h7b0gtOFg\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1061017502094843904\nIn video games, new players often start off with âA Taste of Powerâ.

Those stories encapsulated complex beliefs, intuition, and reasoning. The key insights were often not something A/B-able: the territory was revealed by \"look at this prototype.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943797159219200\nMetrics and A/B-ing are sometimes useful tools for evaluating pieces of the chain of ideas. I was wrong: when companies mindlessly A/B, the issue is not that this tool is useless; the issue is often that they don't really *have* an interconnected chain of ideas.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943796542693376\nDifferent tools help us survey different parts of the territory and validate different parts of the chain of ideas that represents the map. We choose tools according to our confidence in each link and according to their cost, sensitivity, specificity, field of view, etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943795850596352\nWhat matters is the interconnected chain of ideas that leads from [observed need, market state, org capacity, insights about reality, values] to [design decisions, trade-offs, strategic bets].\n\nThat map needs to match territory.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943795125014529\nThis has been one of the biggest culture clashes for me since leaving Apple. The difference here is so striking.\n\nFor the first couple years, I bristled at all the metrics and A/B-ing at other tech companies (and in e.g. academic HCI).

My instinct is that thereâs value in always being *able* to interact, even if most people exclusively do so during narrative pausesâmeans you donât have to track state before acting on an impulse.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1056928940378312704\n@dsemenov @3blue1brown @ben_eater @hamish_todd Yes! Itâs great. I almost listed it. I think itâs not quite the same medium, though, because this experience is mostly not interactive throughout. Still worth listing for comparison, especially since Hamish does some more game-like âturnsâ of control.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1056228156594483200\nCombining video, interactive visualizations, &amp; game-like prompts, Visualizing Quaternions is an exciting entrant in a hazy new medium by @3blue1brown + @ben_eater: https://t.co/QjtKL5ky6k\n\nHow might this medium evolve? I discuss 3 models in this new post: https://t.co/QFRuikdXEH\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1055992600748941312\nI am now doing this in ALL my teaching settings. People understand it right away; they have fun doing it; it literally creates a buzz; and it's much nicer than raising hands (nobody has to \"out\" themselves widely); and more. DO IT. YOU WILL BE HAPPY. https://t.co/jBDt1aYxs9\nhttps://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1055519977086713858\nNature: \"Logging hypotheses and protocols before performing research seems to work as intended: to reduce publication bias for positive results.\" https://t.co/qVBYyMfye4\nhttps://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1055191928340340736\nFun visual illusion: The square on the left is actually bigger, but vision scientists will say they are actually the same size b/c years of visual illusions have conditioned their response. https://t.co/BmEYBWCYjy\nhttps://twitter.com/TomerUllman/status/1055126997356109824\n@michael_nielsen @kocienda Yes! Which in turn creates lovely prompts:\n* How might we make the joyful things you already do better supply you with deep skills?\n* How might we help you plot a path from your position to some goal which traverses only joyful activities which result in deep skills?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054804838368702465\n@kocienda Yes, but possibly only if itâs a skill the child has decided they want to acquire. At this point, better for me to direct you to the relevant passage. You might enjoy the paper, which has some personal relevance: this is the one where Kay famously drew a (better) iPad in 1972. https://t.co/A9WtqIORV4\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054799622697177089\n@stevedekorte No, the claim is weaker than that. E.g. for students who have grown up in households/communities with minimal attention or conversation (and who therefore possess language deficits), direct instruction remediated those deficits more reliably and rapidly than other methods.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054797850754908161\n@kocienda No, Kay argues that we should choose goals which emphasize leaps of beauty and insight over, say, proficiency with a set of standard skills. So: is it possible that student-directed methods support the former but are judged by the latter?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054796942490779649\nIndeed! Per Kay: perhaps we should instead be optimizing ânumber of Sistine Chapel ceilings per generation.â https://t.co/rOh7cyuhej https://t.co/G2K8eycgQI\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054768366462754816\n@optimizingke Alas, the major direct comparisons with DI predate that effort but I find it fascinating.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054767750592192512\n@optimizingke Yep, youâre definitely right.

Wonder how to measure it, butâis there a mindset difference for you? e.g. for handwriting:\n* slow input means it's a \"calmer\" vibe, yielding \"slow thought\"âsometimes good?\n* I often spontaneously interleave mental maps + diagrams\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1035931033026224129\n@kamens @rsnous @danluu I see it as a neat convergence of top-down and bottom-up: top-down, the mandate was \"60fps or death\"; mid-level, the mandate was \"code like embedded engineers; we'll be tracking who's slow!\"; the 1-2 devs who did touch decided \"that means no malloc\" (among other things).\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1035929229328674816\n@rsnous @danluu Another story came to mind you might find interestingâalso probably applicable to these realtime ML systems: as of a few years ago, in some spots, iOS actually *predicts* where your touch will be one frame in the future based on past motion to squeeze out one frame of latency.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1035711705639088128\n@Desmos I love that the platform y'all have is flexible enough that you could express this interesting idea without lots of one-off work.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1035682780913385473\n@rsnous @danluu 100%! I was part of a project trying to cut one frame of latency out of iOS's touch response.

Done in 3 hours.ð\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/999664280965300225\nHad a great lesson yesterday on the ills of segregating media by mode of production:\n1. Team's been working on a detailed narrative of its work (default: let's collaborate in Google Docs)\n2. Oh, butâ¦ there's all these important visuals and juicy quotes (try a slide doc?)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/999664280260657155\n@devonzuegel The fluid semi-synchrony seems so important to the medium; not sure quite how to pin it down conceptually. But practically speaking sometimes I engage in the mode of a conversation for that moment; other times I engage in the mode of taping up a poster and walking away.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/998426332945006593\n@devonzuegel A big lounge with people walking around, coming, going, running into each othersâ conversations, ringed by walls of whiteboards where folks who may not be here at the moment have left thoughts/work that may be nucleating conversation.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/998425391386652672\n(And all these are different from discussion around a figure visually summarizing key ideas!)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997887062593306624\n@sophiebits Outlines can communicate structure and the broad presence or absence of big ideas but donât have enough meat to portray much about framing, emphasis, explanation. I suspect this makes discussing e.g. areas of skepticism harder: the points are too abstract.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997886281425158144\n1. Conversation around a bullet-point outline\nis different from\n2. Conversation around a first draft of a complete document\nis different from\n3. Conversation around a three-page prose reduction of a complete document.\n\nTrying #3 has shown me the limitations of #1 and #2 alone.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997872715032805378\nBesides their explicit answers, the overview also facilitates conversation about the project more generallyâhow they conceptualize it, what they're skeptical about, what they find important. It's super valuable to have those insights *before* writing a full draft!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997872714307158018\nTried a fun method this week. My team's documenting a big projectâwill take weeks. We wrote an overview with 1Â¶ summaries for each full section (most yet to be written), then asked stakeholders: which Â¶s' full sections do you most want to dig into? which sections are missing?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997872713183084544\n@daiyitastic Yeah, I've found most of western Europe to be very cash-culture.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997105384912441345\nTiny mundane future-is-here: was just traveling in Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. I was dreading the hassle of four different currencies in two weeksâ¦ but I never needed cash once! Everything took card. First time that's happened on a big trip like this for me.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/997104757775908864\n@Freerunnering Hm, itâs possible yes, but the correlation is consistent with other places I visit in US and internationally, not just SF. Nordic countries appear to be an exception!\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/995752548412919808\n@jaanus Ah!

Even the for-sale real estate prices seem quite cheap relative to SF: any ideas there?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/995733875941920769\n@ahandvanish Yes, in some cases! But even the domestic stuff is much higher priced here, relative to housing. And VAT isnât high enough to account for it. ð¤\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/995733594969690114\nI donât think âhigh tax welfare statesâ alone explain it: many things are &gt;50% more expensive than in SF, but VAT and income tax differences wouldnât explain that. And average rent is less than half SFâs. (c.f. https://t.co/dfjsDxKiMx)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/995699354416701440\nNaive economics question for you, Twitter! Iâve been traveling in Scandinavia, where cost-of-living seems weirdly skewed: cheap-ish real estate, expensive meals and goods (relative to SF).\n\nIn other places Iâve traveled, these usually correlate, but not here. What gives?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/995699350587215877\nAt Helsinkiâs Design Museum, they wanted to have an exhibit displaying a variety of designersâ contracts to demystify and illustrate the range.\n\nThey couldnât collect enough so they exhibited blank sheets of paper. https://t.co/IDrLGqTQod\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/994832079547400193\nOslo has very reliable buses!

Happy to help! Itâs quite a broad topicâcan you say more about your goals?\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/958792357607911424\nI learned that \"red, yellow, &amp; blue are the primary colors (e.g. for paint)\" as a kid. Somehow I didn't notice a conflict with \"cyan, magenta, &amp; yellow are the primary colors for printing\" until recently.\n\nWonderful images showing limitations of RYB here! https://t.co/o1pUiTnqFZ https://t.co/HEJsFx1cUZ\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/958769106844491776\nIn some instances, the skew between many universities' goals and the situation on the ground is quite dizzying, e.g. this gulf between institutions' views of how well they prepare students for professional work and how business leaders judge the same. https://t.co/Dm8DXEZRDq\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/958597413761056769\n4. Play out the implications of the goal as seriously as you can. That might look likeâ¦ (e.g. students should live in a rotation of international cities, collaborating with local communities)\n5. â¦ and indeed, that's exactly what we're doing.\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/958597412595159040\n1. All universities *say* they want toâ¦ (e.g. help students attain a global perspective)\n2. â¦ but they're not really doing it (e.g. many students rarely stray from campus)\n3. â¦ for these possible structural reasons (e.g. we think of a university as a place)\nhttps://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/958597411538112513\nReflecting on my notes from Minerva's book, I think I'm most struck by just how seriously it takes its own goals and their associated implications.

I wrote this based on the setup I had during my postdoc which was 100% paper. Most recently, pre-Roam, it's been a mix of scrivener, scapple, email, workflowy, iPad notebooks, paper notebooks ð« https://t.co/eISzGg1CcD\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203754739621433345\n@Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] I'm guessing this is already on your roadmap, but the solution is permission buckets, where everything tagged \"multitemporality book\" could be given the same permission settings, but with people with access to multiple projects, crosslinks and transclusions still work.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203753490696167424\n@Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] But the permissions thing is a good one and doesn't mess with the hedgehog second brain model. I might want to share my book project notes with Alice but not Bob, my science fiction novel attempt with Bob but not Alice, and my personal notes with my wife but no outsiders.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203753102613999616\n@Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] The branding reason I think is a possibly bad one because it creates a tradeoff with the hedgehoggy-second-brain model, which makes me think you should be cautious about building out in the direction of highly polished publishing media with skinning, logos, domain names etc\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203752732152094720\n@Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] One of the things you're going to run into is people wanting to separate out projects. Currently I'm using it only for 1 project, and I see two different reasons for wanting separate ones: separate \"branding\" for public things and separate permissions.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203752363053350912\n@francisregan [[@RoamResearch]] From my limited use of OneNote and Evernote theyâre both a generation too primitive and optimized fir a different style of thinking so theyâre not on this spectrum.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203747608516157445\nSo a tool with a 2h minimum can sustain a 10x bigger positive-rate knowledge base with the same budget of people/money than a 4h minimum. I suspect for Roam, a very suitable project may get it down to minutes, and for a typical project, maybe 30min.\n\nSomething like that.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203747151425064960\nMy suspicion is, a good KPI for a knowledge tool is minimum threshold of time required to make a negentropic update to it, with every halving of the threshold increasing its capacity to hold positive-interest-rate knowledge repos by an order of magnitude.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203746592617947136\nThis btw is the maker time/manager time problem pg wrote about. Making needs 4 hour chunks because anything less tends to increase entropy rather than decrease it in any non-trivial knowledge work project. So anything that lowers that lower limit is a big win.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203745235534147584\nBy contrast in weaker media, I have to be in high energy, direct focus headspace, having warmed up around 30 minutes to get situation awareness around the whole project. Only then can I reliably lower entropy and turn interest rate positive. Roam lowers threshold to 10% of that.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203744716820369408\nIn practice, Iâm finding now that when I have a new nugget to add, from whatever headspace Iâm in (working, at the gym, random thought during in a meeting, half-asleep thought in bed), I can always make a quick judgment  of approximately where a thought belongs, and put it there.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203743475671285762\nCompare for instance Wikipedia (~100s-1000s unpaid) or Stanford Encyclopedia or Wolfram Mathworld (single digits -100s, but paid, directly it indirectly).\n\nThis is probably because Roam allows one mind to effectively act as many (Fox &gt; Hedgehog)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203742941929279489\nSo a good measure of the technical sophistication of a medium is to measure the number of people (eyeballs) and money (how much theyâre paid) required to sustain a positive interest rate. I think Roam reduces both to the limit: 1 person and self-funded hobby time.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203742277773885440\nAnytime Iâve seen a positive-interest-rate knowledge repo, itâs because many people were resurfacing bits and pieces at random and making point improvements. So the only known solution to date for positive interest rate has been to collectivize and socialize the prosthetic memory\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203741612007931904\nIn the past most such efforts have failed because they relied on automation to try and keep entropy at bay, which sort of works weakly with relative legible and structured information. But for more squishy information, the only thing that works is a âmany eyeballsâ process.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203741098230743040\nKnowledge generally depreciates, and a holy grail of knowledge modeling and capture for a long time has been to reverse the default negative interest rate it accrues and turn it positive. There was a âknowledge bankingâ project at Xerox back in the day that aimed at this for eg.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203740466472091650\nThe thing is, recall is a virtuous cycle. The better a medium supports recall, the easier it is to attach new information in the right places. Which makes recall even easier. And the easier it is to add content, the faster this process snowballs. So a compound interest effect.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203739927009062912\nTwitter: 4 (strong searchability, strong threadability, weak gestalt)\n\nWiki: 5 (strong searchability, medium threadability, strong gestalt)\n\nBlog: 6 (strong searchability, strong threadability, strong gestalt)\n\nRoam: 8 (all of the above plus low friction update/create/rename)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203739165214461953\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, ranking media Iâve used\n\nPaper: 1 (no recall aids unless you create ToCs or indices yourself)\n\nEmail newsletters: 2 (weak searchability, weak theme/thread continuity, weak gestalt, though substack is better than mailchimp)\n...\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203737896697511936\nGonna start documenting subtle features here.

They really work to create a good employee experience too. It's mostly low-wage customer service jobs, but they seem kinda happy with the carnivalesque internal culture and aren't driven like slaves.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203386560915243009\nVery few products in traditional marketing unironically positioned themselves as identitycore products. Cars perhaps. Education (college). Healthcare and insurance products.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203386241246347264\nWhen you see ads for (for eg) coca-cola or pringles, it is clear that the marketers understand this isn't your life, it's a snack. The lifestyle narratives presented in commercials has a subtext of cheerful irony/absurdity. This is missing in DTC ads I see on Facebook.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203385898865315840\nThere is something weird about the v-commerce/DTC world, in that they seem to unironically think customer identities are shaped by a single product (t-shirt, razors, shorts, luggage, backpacks, water bottles)... this is a mistake old-school marketing never made.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203385591725010945\nIf you sell only one non-life-or-death product or service, chances that your customer's whole-life holistic identity is coupled to consuming your product is zero. There is no point being obsessed with a narrow aspect of someone's life that they themselves are not.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203385326946775040\nFor the latter, two ways to test if your business qualifies. You might either sell so many things \"share of wallet\" is the best metric (Amazon, Walmart) OR you touch such a broad swathe of the information the customer consumes you can shape their mind (Facebook, Twitter)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203384859932028928\nI think the two situations in which \"customer obsession\" is a meaningful corporate value are:\n\na) life or death matters are involved\n\nb) you see enough sides of a customer's life that the internal model is not a one-product cartoon (ie all the broad tech platforms)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203384374386806784\nFinally read the Away story. My main reaction was: I understand this mindset for running a space mission or an ER during a crisis... but for customers of... overrated luggage?\n\nNot all customers deserve customer obsession as a corporate value\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203375939364646912\nsomething lost in the Away situation is: it's fucking luggage. these god damn monsters are giving people panic attacks over premium-mediocre suitcases. eat the fucking rich\nhttps://twitter.com/_CBN_/status/1203370917411164161\nHave yourself a premium mediocre Christmas https://t.co/c4i2ooPprW\nhttps://twitter.com/georgebaily/status/1203370849287323648\nOrange is the new premium mediocre?\n\nht @vegan \n\nhttps://t.co/Zvb3VmMdyY https://t.co/lO0ZcRfHWd\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203370673717968898\nThe evolutionary task is: what are the meaningful features of this situation Iâm in right now?

The second kind, if you get to know them, you start reading them.\n\nIâm mostly the first type, so for me, the cost of making friends with a reader is often losing that reader.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202067263701962752\nI get along surprisingly well with bullshit-detector/calling-bullshit types, considering the extent to which everything I do is brazen bullshitting ð¤\n\nOr maybe one day Iâll say something about igon values and theyâll all turn on me and sacrifice me to God of Irreproducibility\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202063470662803456\nhttps://t.co/1pYCaXhGTT\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202020542380773376\nInteresting article by Peter Redfield about how (literal) band-aids are not really (metaphoric) band-aids, and how the metaphor illustrates a bias against \"micro\" interventions for \"macro\" problems https://t.co/AxxXKVNNLx\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202017385047195648\n(ps she isn't on twitter afaik, but happy to make an introduction if people active in diversity-in-tech stuff want to connect)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202000136378834945\nGot my preview copy of new book, Hacking Diversity, by my @berggruenInst buddy Christina Dunbar-Hester.

When you go to a hospital for anything, you kinda have to act like a CEO doing an analyst call or shareholder meeting. And shareholder is apt analogy.

But they arenât going anywhere. Good time to invest actually.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199872674173816833\n@celestialboon This is a meaningless criticism by a self-important mystic. Ideology is just a given of human behavior that manifests under certain conditions. Calling it poisonous is like calling gravity poisonous or hair poisonous.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199871724692443136\nIf you ditch ideology, youâll at least find someone to hold accountable within your means. Not vote for them, not work with them, not buy their stuff etc. This is what cancel culture clumsily tries to do, except via mob judgment contagion rather than actual distributed judgment.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199871217282338816\nTrick to breaking out of these patterns is to ignore analyses that do not center specific behaviors of named people.\n\nWhen you do that, it will turn into a game of no-true-Scotsman. Pick 2 of 3: a name, an ideology, responsibility for a problem\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199870195516329987\n@Aelkus Thatâs not a problem, itâs a feature.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199868709017288704\nNote what happens in such discourses. Specific problems are plausibly everybodyâs fault and therefore nobodyâs fault.\n\nNobody has to change behavior, everybody gets to preach at everybody else, recommending specific moral evolutions to them from vice to virtue.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199867035175374850\nIdeology, like love, means never having to say youâre sorry.\n \nExample: when market failures happen through distortions/ externalities, capitalists blame state institutions, libertarians blame cronyism, socialists blame greedy individualism. Nobody has to accept any blame.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199866447087824896\nThis intersubjective approach to ideological self-definition is pragmatic, operationalizes and weaponizes attribution error at scale, successfully casts all failures as aberrations caused by the vices of others, and ensures you never have to admit youâre wrong about anything.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199865608696819712\nExample 2, (socialism, capitalism), (socialism, libertarianism)\n\nX1: compassion, Y1: greed\nX2: community, Y2: selfishness\n\nExample 3 (libertarianism, socialism), (libertarian, capitalism*)\n\nX1: individualism, Y1: bureaucracy\nX2: innovation, Y2: cronyism\n\n* capitalism in practice\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199865066142584833\nExample: some degree of free-riding is an obviously likely in a welfare state, so that incentive becomes the definition of socialism. Their internal justifications (eg compassion) can be rejected as hypocrisy. But their own behavior is explained by âefficient marketâ not âgreedâ.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199864095933026304\nThis is a neat arrangement because what it does is define the ideology via arguments of convenience against the specific weaknesses of competitors, based on their visible incentives while explaining their iwn behavior in terms of reasonable necessity rather than incentives.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199863369643122688\nPoint is, no ideology is ever characterized from first principles in practice. People who try to do that are (correctly) dismissed as impractical fundamentalists. An  ideology only exists as a set of pairwise defenses of solipsistic self-certainty against *specific* competitors.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199862624545984512\nExample, for (capitalism, socialism), (capitalism, libertarianism) we get\n\nX1: market\nY1: lazy free-riding\n\nX2: efficiencies of scale\nY2: naÃ¯vetÃ© of small-scale/decentralized idealism\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199861741942738945\nThere is no consensus external view because the outside-in views do not harmonize. So the choice for an insider is to believe in either a solipsistic and self-serving self-image or an incoherent union of outside-in critical moral judgments that can be dismissed as incoherent.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199861144552275968\nSo an ideology is characterized by a set of statements asserting pairwise relations of the form:\n\nâMy foundation is this proven mechanism X that works, your foundation is this vice Y you refuse to trade for a virtueâ \n\nThe solipsistic self-image is ((X1, Y1), (X2, Y2),...)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199860368924823552\nHad a little thought. We tend to characterize ideologies in internal (âsubjectiveâ) or external (âobjectiveâ) terms, but in practice work with them in intersubjective ways, where the first class citizen is the directed ideology pair like (capitalism, communism).\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199859148172562432\n@ctbeiser Also as article points out, much of Sanders support is P, though heâs in denial about it and thinks itâs W\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199844894010773504\n@ctbeiser Except P is so down for the count and battered it doesnât even make for a good punching bag for resentment and scapegoating anymore. I think it will still win, but via Trump return. There isnât enough energy or reason to switch to a new version of the same state.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199844332104105985\nI think the reason is it was too large scale. Even blue cities economy that SV tried to solve is too big. A workable minimum-viable 3-way coalition of WPC has to start much smaller. Like a single medium-sized city not yet rendered ð by financialization, nimbys and Chinese buyers\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199843619487662080\nIf it had worked it would have created a new basis for trust. What SV actually delivered:\n\nW = increasingly stressful gig economy with Ponzi scheme capital on top, automation nipping at heels\n\nP = build an API based on adtech and financialization\n\nC = fake returns over new wealth\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199842117155115008\nSV promised to be that:\n\nW = under the API labor with rewards and dignity of industrial work and the self-determination and flexibility of digital.\n\nP = over-the-API work to turn capital into returns for  C, more humane work for W\n\nC = real new wealth from software eats world\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199841253707304960\nThe on,y way out is to abandon these broad class divisions entirely and seed very small scale W+P+C coalitions that both work and capture the imagination in a way that creates a *new* basis for trust.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199840424090898432\nAll three are under different patterns of identity stress and economic stress (yes even the capitalists; the r&gt;g theater does not run itself) that they need help from the other two to solve but there is so little trust no broad alliances are possible. Only uneasy splintering.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199839492896505856\nIf pick-two-of-three were still viable, this triangle of quasistable outcomes is what we get, as @interfluidity argued.

It kills the wishful belief that 2-of-3 coalitions are still possible right now. In 2016, capitalist (C) and working classes (W) allied to hand professional elite class (P) a bloody nose. C+W&gt;P triangle inequality. https://t.co/lVCGzz5vBE\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199836531931795456\n@rob_knight @tomcritchlow @iChris @kylemathews well, it's a start. The \"site\" the domain maps to can simply be a browser-readable map of stuff strewn about the web that has a sort of soft DNS lookup, where domain-name URL is kinda like a content-addressing hash rather than a location pointer\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199827645594136576\nOne solution: run for POTUS on campaign promise of a Purge, but where elites get free guns, and if they survive, they get UBI and climate action. The masses get to mount the heads of any elites they take down on spikes. 0.1% capital winners will be parked in orbit during Purge\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199827210569281536\nSo on the narrow question of winning POTUS, the right candidate would be a mix of Obama and Trump: promise hope to the elites and the chance to bloody a few noses to the laboring class. The paradox being they want to bloody the noses of the class looking for hope.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199826500121321475\nI think the tldr is: the laboring class is politically still potent but economically a deadweight loss and everybody (including they themselves) knows it and has acknowledged it. The professional class still thinks it has a shot at resurrection.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199826148085026817\nThe most important insight I got out of this was how Warren and Sanders each solve one half of the problem but make the other half intractable.

Even billionaires begin and end days with maintenance chores: teeth brushing. At least that has mint flavor.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196700678518759424\nWe already live in the highest maintenance society ever, almost entirely due to one technology: TV. Every day a big chunk of humans watch 2-4 hours of life from a high-interestingness/low-maintenance fictional metaverse, go to bed for a bit, and then do 8h maintenance work\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196699148247953409\nMaybe thereâs an alternative conception of AI as SM. Self-maintaining systems. IBM at one point was trying something stuffily named autonomic computing that was sorta this idea. Forget intelligence and recursive self-improvement.

It is simply a kind of rational laziness that can look like it under certain behavioral lenses.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196489527746912257\nBasically, this so-called postmodern peasant is simply someone who has some mix of laziness, indifference, and lack of curiosity about, how modern technology works, and a rational assessment that they're probably not smart enough to understand most of it.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196489281235083264\nIf you've actually met people with literalist magical thinking beliefs, there is no way you'd be confused about this. There's no way my ironic messing around with horoscopes is anything like my grandparents sincere reliance on horoscopes for major life decisions.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196488876266639360\nBelieving in this kind of neo-medievalist reading of the modern human condition is a bit like believing visitors to Disneyland actually believe in fairies and princesses and large anthropomorphic rodents named Mickey, just because they might wear some larping costumes.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196488549597470726\nA big tell is that genuine magical beliefs induce uncritical reverence for wielders of esoteric knowledge. Far from being treated as Merlins, the literate magicians of postmodernity are largely treated with something between patronizing contempt and resentful anger.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196487832354709504\nWhat's going on here is an ironic apathy that might in some narrow respects be functionally similar to behavior governed by magical belief systems, but there's no way you can confuse naive magical belief for the typical postmodern variety https://t.co/3FkY4SDV7d\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196487583859003392\nWhoops wrong link for the Zizek thing https://t.co/RH3feH2vRr\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196487285081923586\nIt takes weird contortions to pretend that these modes are in like the medieval ones they superficially resemble.

Define the category with the best unbrand.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196195271903854592\n@magicsilicon Central bender was merely supervising the two 60% benders in that episode (my line is a reference to a running gag in that episode)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196183711697362944\nI did TWO things today https://t.co/u7UiNlA1ZK\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196181717565919232\n@nayafia @RhysLindmark That's normal. Many funding sources like DARPA are in fact explicitly structured to allow such cycling. I think the wild vs. focused axis is orthogonal to self-controlled vs. institutionally-controlled funding continuity. I'd like full-lifecycle capability for myself :)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196173018466156544\n@crashdev meet @SamoBurja .... he's visiting Seattle. I think you'd find a meeting interesting. \n\nSamo -- Chris is one of the primary architects/instigators of the Seattle startup scene.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196172524909817856\n@tomcritchlow Itâs ability to generate funding for research reliably, year after year, without having a permanent institutional home, or even a temporary one.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196125031316652033\n@tomcritchlow Itâs not really indie in the sense Iâm talking about. Iâm officially an adjunct faculty at USC as part of this gig so a part of the traditional system. In fact the power of this gig is what leads me to see the stark inadequacy of true, ie unaffiliated, âindie researchâ conceits.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196121395219951616\nI wonder what would happen if I invited people to send me 1-page proposals in a pro-forma for indie mini-CAREER grants and just threw up a page linking to all of them, then promoting that page. I bet I could match at least a few proposals to private funding sources ð¤\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196117203013103616\n@mathieuhelie No, thatâs mostly patent trolling, and a toxic activity.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196115458618843136\n@evanwolf DARPA, DoE, and NIH styles are not as well suited for independent researchers because they typically focus on more ambitious things requiring teams and more infrastructure. Theyâre like pure enterprise-grade where NSF is at least partly consumer-grade.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196115303492534272\nStrange-looping in a secondary meta thread I did later. https://t.co/g8p7Lvj9Mx\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196114195474829320\nIf the university research world is concerned about competition from a parallel independent research world catalyzed by private funding and alternate norms, one that currently has vanishingly tiny funding (mostly self-funding) compared to their world, you have to wonder: why?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196111467965083648\nItâs a ritual in the university world to whine about how research funding is under threat. But from the outside, people would correctly conclude that the system has near-monopolistic access to a vast public funding budget. And my proposal doesnât even envision touching that.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196110561148190720\nAside: a few seem to be reading this thread as a proposal for a disruptive attack on the university research system rather than speculations for a parallel system for a potential indie research world. But yes, it could potentially lead to competition, which would be a good thing.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196109031649116161\nHereâs John Carmackâs announcement which is what got me tweeting. Not sure what gotbthe others thinking about this right now. https://t.co/eAwdS3GSuu\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196108028673544193\nAnd hereâs a piece by James Gallagher https://t.co/pcXzjxmUWX\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196107299456077824\nI seem to have accidentally joined a mini-wave of commentary on indie research. Here is @nayafia describing her experience, a kind of edge case between the sort of indie research Iâm talking about and existing institutional margins. https://t.co/a6ntSu8PSJ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196106949097447424\nSeveral people seem to be misunderstanding this part of my argument. The CAREER grant is a good calibration point even though itâs only a tiny fraction, because itâs what creates new research CAPACITY in the university system out of new PhD ranks. Thatâs what Iâd like to see 3xed\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196105071295172608\n@DanielWhiteson Itâs a deliberately focused comparison on the startup phase that allow research careers to be bootstrapped. I am aware that total funding is vastly larger. I am not suggesting undermining the university system, merely providing an alternative to it for independent researchers.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196103902313119746\nClarification: I only considered CAREER grants rather than the vastly larger total funding pie because bootstrapping theâstartupâ phase is the hardest part of research. My speculative assumption is that if thatâs solved, enough will succeed that larger pie will emerge organically https://t.co/zXFRJ8NUOZ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196102815543750658\n@Danderso13 Getting bootstrapped is the hardest part.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196099182081269763\nInstagram griftonimics https://t.co/bov35G1SEG\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195974273921208321\nManifestos are to institutional innovation as faith healing is to surgery\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195966913861439488\nTweeting unironically about serious topics is so off-brand for me now I barely recognize myself when I do it.\n\nThereâs a few topics I feel uniquely qualified to seriouspost publicly about though. A good change of pace even if nobody who matters listens. \n\nNow back to shitposting.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195965169706229760\n@Noahpinion I predict they will not be attempted so your prediction is moot ð\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195963058608209920\nI was very lucky btw, to have so many options, and a generally cheerful and positive mindset exiting academia, feeling good about myself and my choices. The university system traumatizes and destroys 4-5 people for every 1 it shapes positively. Itâs ugly out there.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195958127725694976\nMy own future ambitions beyond indie writing and publishing are pretty modest, so I can self-fund most things I care to research on the margins of non-research stuff and donât need anyone besides me to care about outcomes. No desire to shoot for John Carmack level goals.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195956485957636096\n* SBIR and STTR, for those unfamiliar with it, is a rather sorry-ass federal small business innovation grants program that in theory should sustain indie research, but in practice ends up subsidizing military-industry complex subcontracting layer\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195955265369079808\nWould have been nice to have this option in 2006 though, when my choices were: second postdoc, govt lab, industry, a sketchy faculty position offer I didnât like, and SBIR grinding. I created blogger-consultant option for myself ~2007 and that worked well for me but doesnât scale\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195954678476886017\nPersonally Iâm aged out of directly benefiting from this kind of infrastructure and am not missionary enough to try and lead an effort to make it happen for others.\n\nHappy to play wingman to anyone with the hustle and network to try though. Iâve thought this through a lot ð\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195954070512488448\nThereâs probably a way this solves the adjunct crisis too, but Iâll leave that for another day (itâs an overlapping population but not coextensive with indie research target population... maybe 30% overlap)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195952375367778304\nIn this picture the traditional university doesnât get disrupted so much as have its role refactored into a sort of infrastructure cloud provisioning role. \n\nIâd expect much of this sort of thing to happen in university ecosystems actually.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195952158299971585\nWhatâs the alternative? The innovation economy finally kills the dying golden goose for the last few golden eggs, and enters a late stage fraud economy competing with NIMBY grifters in decaying urban cores. Stockbuybackitis infects SV too. The music stops.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195950117087432704\nIncome-share education models already exist and offer a competitive alternative to the teaching function of universities and get out of the unsustainable student debt balloon. \n\nR&amp;D can be unbundled too.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195949343817134080\nIâd revamp publishing, peer review models, etc, as well, since the model that exists is failing even for university research (hence reproducibility crisis, impact factor gaming, purely cronyism predatory journal empires etc) but thatâs a secondary mechanism design problem.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195948613865623552\nI bet every top 5 VC,  PE, and Big Tech firm could each sustain 20% NSF CAREER type indie research network, 3x-ing total R&amp;D bandwidth of the US. \n\nWith expectations of open source/license output. Restock the commons without need for big 60s/70s style government programs.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195947272963383298\nI think the R&amp;D loop can be closed with tech wealth and investment capital. Universities can be unbundled. Thereâs no good reason to keep teaching, research, and service in the same costly brick and mortar bundle anymore.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195945989468647431\nNow that model is struggling, I have to wonder why huge capital stocks created from that legacy investment arenât being plowed back into the head of the funnel. \n\nPossibly SV has gotten used to easy private wealth building off of publicly funded feedstock.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195945304320667648\nThe research university model worked well for about 60 years after WW2. It supplied both the talent and the IP feedstock (not just STEM, humanities/liberal arts as well) to drive American business growth an leadership. Z\n\nBasically free in-kind money for the innovation economy.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195944349537718273\nBasically thereâs a bullshit R&amp;D funnel argument that people trot out to explain slowing of new business formation and general innovation stagnation/falling business dynamism (similar to the one around diversity in tech hiring).\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195943797168820225\nAnd indie research would dispense with indirect cost support (~50% overhead charge that research universities typically charge agencies to pay for brick-and-mortar infrastructure, a big innovation in its time, due to Vannevar Bush).\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195942913017954306\nSV people tend to be free market ideologues, yet their free market idealism mysteriously vanishes when talking about this stuff. SoftBank alone could fund something like this probably.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195942373693378560\nIâm making this arithmetic comparison because SV investors sometimes act like basic research is entirely out of their reach and all they can do is draft off of output of big government R&amp;D programs running over decades. This is just not true anymore.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195940842973777920\nLetâs look at Silicon Valley.  Last I checked, Series A, B, C, and D rounds are ~10 million, 20mm, 50mm, 100mm. Might be off by a bit.\n\nSo... doubling research capacity of entire university system = 20 As, 10 Bs, 4 Cs, or 2 Ds.\n\nEntirely within the capacity of SV capital market\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195940353561387008\nAt grad student stipend level, youâre talking about a quarter that. 25k/year. So you could support about 1200 grad student level researchers for the same amount. So $19- million gets you somewhere between 300 to 1200 bets on independent researchers. Now who can afford that?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195939211536289792\nA subset of ~20 get PECASE awards which push up the 100k to 500k/yr, sp thatâs another 40 million. This 190 million basically supports 300 new faculty every year which I think is approximately ALL new faculty in say the top 25-30 universities.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195938439910154245\nOn one extreme you can think UBI, which is roughly ~ early grad student level $. \n\nOn the other extreme, you could think of early career faculty grants.\n\nAn NSF CAREER grant is 100k/year for 5 yrs, and in 2018, about 150 million was disbursed or about 300.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195937867349889024\nThinking about my thread this morning on why independent research is hard, and what it would take to make it possible, and whether itâs within the reach of private investors who ALL complain endlessly about how they have far too much capital and donât know where to put it. https://t.co/V313rcBrVh\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195937380210921472\nSmartasses https://t.co/8huNNrvg0a\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195914943603720192\n@LAForeverHall Off with her head!\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195909897910534146\nlol @ recommended content: https://t.co/aU0xxRdKBe\nhttps://twitter.com/doriantaylor/status/1195892685883596800\nWhen Iâm king the first year of my reign will be Year 0, fixing this stupid mess once and for all\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195885191765487616\n@MNWH ð¤¬\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195881614045147139\nDoes the next decade begin with 2020 or 2021? ð¤\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195876813605498880\nI wonder if any of the 2020 democrat candidates are capable of losing a significant % of 2016 Clinton voters to Trump in 2020 if they win the nomination. Is there research on how they stack up on this measure?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195843134451679232\nOne thing I probably could do is raise funding for a small research institution/lab working on problems in the 6-8 range. Maybe 4-5 staff. The thing is I donât want to run a research org, which is an entirely different interest/ambition than doing research. It takes a COO type.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195839569674899456\nThis scale isnât commentary on the intelligence, creativity, or imagination of the people who do such work. Higher on the scale is simply riskier, more time-consuming, and requires more backend work, even holding the human factor constant\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195836709033787392\n1. Intelligence briefs\n2. Gartneresque research\n3. Investigative journalism\n3. Market research\n4. Broad societal trend research\n5. Data-heavy trend research, pure math\n6. Tech futures, humanities\n7.  S/W tech, social science\n8. Generic STEM\n9. Big science\n10. Paradigm shifts\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195836043074781189\nMany things get called âresearchâ and a lot of ego-sensitivity gets attached to it. I think of it mainly in terms of (high risk of no valuable output)*(high ratio of invisible to visible output)*(high time demands). Let me try to pseudo-quantify this and take the ego element out:\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195833555139477504\nDonât mean to be a downer. Thereâs possibly imaginative models that could work in indie mode that I simply havenât thought of.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195832484493053952\n@EvanSandhoefner Iâm not thinking about indie content creators in general for the most part, but about indie research as on the other thread Iâm tweeting this morning. Sorry if that was not obvious. Forgot to string this on that thread.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195832111359332352\n@Cathal72887956 That sounds like research in the sense of investigative journalism, which is a much cheaper thing to sustain\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195831745842569222\n@edsaperia @kevinmarks @nwspk Being first/original on a topic is not actually a primary motivation in research for most researchers in my experience. Interestingness is the primary driver. Nobody picks a problem simply because itâs at the intersection of fundable by a model and unworked-on.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195831254744125440\n@kevinmarks @edsaperia @nwspk Not for me. I got very little out of peers. It was pure;y about paid-for time for me.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195830592417353728\nList of actually credible indie researchers\n\n1. Stephen Wolfram (math/complexity/computation)\n2. Jeff Hawkins (neuroscience)\n3. John Carnack (AGI)\n\nNotice something, besides the fact theyâre smart and have the right subject-matter prep?\n\nThey got rich first ð\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195830177206427648\n@edsaperia @kevinmarks @nwspk For a small fraction of addressable problems\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195829233806757888\n@EvanSandhoefner Itâs not a âcostâ, itâs an incompatibility. You donât get to decide to treat it as a cost for arbitrary projects, only ones that are first compatible structurally with that model. Thereâs no meaningful way to spin most things in crowd-pleasing ways.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195828857565138944\nA basic thing many fans of crowdfunding seem to be blind to is that crowdfunding = crowdpleasing.\n\nIâve never done crowdfunding because Iâve never yet had a crowdpleasing idea.\n\nLow-unit-cost, high-volume consumer products like my ebooks and newsletter arenât crowd funding\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195824078524805126\nWriting grant proposals to satisfy a few bureaucrats is already enough of a mismatch to research personalities. Crowd-pleasing requires 10x that painful mismatch.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195822063178485760\nA more basic problem with kickstarter type ideas is that anyone good at creating the buzz and hype for that is almost by definition going to be bad at R&amp;D and vice versa. Content mismatch aside.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195821818013077504\n@iampliny See downthread. You wouldnât pay enough ð\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195820971317288960\n@RhysLindmark @nayafia She had a Ford fellowship at one point. I had a16z funding for breaking smart S1 and now Berggruen funding for my new project. I donât consider these indie research.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195820790127575040\n@RhysLindmark @nayafia See first tweet. Like blogging is to traditional book writing. Where youâre not dependent on a big anchor to sustain. I donât need an agent or the book publishing industry to do it. Amazon affiliate and spare time is enough.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195820513307721728\nCurrent plan is to package and flush out what I have so far as a sort of âChristmas Specialâ about 1/5 the scope/ambition of S1.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195820054140424192\nThe topic I wanted to research, and got about 1/3 the way through, was institution building in the Great Weirding. Itâs the sort of thing thatâs not a natural fit for any corporate funding source.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195818881249472512\nA good public example: Breaking Smart S2 was a medium-depth research project I thought I could sustain on my own (a16z supported S1). I gave up looking for funding after a couple of half-hearted pitches to orgs I thought might be a fit for the topic.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195817451566419968\n@_expeditionary Still, doesnât mean you canât or shouldnât also try to do your own thing.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195816319360237568\nIf youâre thinking kickstarter-like funding mechanisms, forget it. Youâll be asking for 10x as much money as typical artistic or startuppy projects, have no natural rewards to hand out, and a far lower likelihood of success.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195815861627437057\n@epithetos Seems to work best in chemistry and pharma for some reason\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195814988230713345\n@RhysLindmark @nayafia Sheâs not talking about the same thing. Her project looks like a classic institutional project. Just not a university one.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195814456661442560\nIronically, most modern tenured faculty donât get to do much R&amp;D either, at least in STEM. Theyâre too busy fund-raising. Theyâre more like angel investors and board advisors to grad students and postdocs. Humanities and social sciences may perhaps be better, I donât know.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195809459936743425\nItâs also reminding me how much I enjoy doing the real thing. Itâs like a year long vacation back to my own past.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195808477983043585\nIâm on a year-long fellowship right now, and this is partly what has made me admit the conceit in the âindie researcherâ self-label. Iâm doing this sort of thinking for the first time since ~2006 or so (the year I last submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed journal). https://t.co/5kK51vHuQ9\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195808159517958144\n@epithetos Iâve done maybe 5k worth of R&amp;D grade modeling work in like 8 years of consulting ð\n\nSlim pickings\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195807408032899072\nI find that autodidacts who havenât experienced institutional R&amp;D environments have a self-congratulatory low threshold for what they count as research. Itâs a bit like vanity publishing or fan fiction. This mismatch doesnât exist as much in indie art, consulting, game dev etc\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195806949893267456\nNote #3\n\nLearning projects to prepare to go deep on a subject are not research even if it feels like it\n\nReading published literature and blogging a few derivative observations is not research\n\nCritiquing/finding flaws in published papers is indie peer-review, not research\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195806253722718208\nNote #2: I enjoy proper research, but wasnât a great talent even at my peak and am now likely at 60%. So in a way this is an okay market outcome. If I were wealthy I might do self-indulgent mediocre research for the rest of my life, but no reason you should pay for it.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195805398319546368\nNote: peer-reviewed publishing or patents just as depth cal9bration. I wouldnât necessarily publish in such forms since I donât think those institutional processes have ever added much to my work. Nor into them tbf, in the peer reviewing Iâve done. But Iâd aim for that depth.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195803626221883392\nThis isnât cheap talk btw. I dropped 2k on a personal Matlab license after I went indie and kept it current for years, and went through dozens of false starts working on various ideas. Couldnât find the time to develop any of them to even bad-conference-paper level.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195803105251606528\nEven if the most expensive research tools like LHC or Hubble got as cheap as Arduinos, it wouldnât help. Thatâs not the cost bottleneck. The bottleneck is researcher time. Even crappiest, cheapest conference paper I ever wrote took at least 6 months (~7k grad student salary then)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195801689476890624\nThe reason software doesnât eat R&amp;D even though people think it should is that tools or open access to published lit/libraries, or free peer-reviewed publishing/presentation forums (if you want that) are only a tiny fraction of the cost for most ideas. The main host is time.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195800271894368256\nBest-case outcome if neither applies: your idea has commercial potential and you can get a startup out of it. Which means the vast majority of ideas, both STEM and humanities, are out. Even Iâm not optimist enough to think your R&amp;D on 16rh century French poets can be a unicorn.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195799062710108160\ntldr: Get tenure, or get rich.

They can just be replaced with new problems, and certain constituencies might simply die out without their problems ever being solved.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193988791381266433\nPeople want to believe in futures marked by active agency and willful action, but sometimes the desire for willful action is wishful thinking. Institutionalists want to create new institutions. Marketists want to give markets time to operate. Militarists want to shoot people.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193988589383634944\nMacro thinkers tend to assume there are 3 basic ways to solve problems: institutions, markets, and organized military conflict (war). No, there are 4. The fourth way is extended chaos, allowing the natural dynamics to play out and create a new default equilibrium condition.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193988126508605440\nInstitutions don't make a comeback simply because institutionalists would like them to. The scars of the torn-down previous generation of institutions have to scab over first.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193987272669986816\nð¤¨ð§this seems like wishful thinking to me.\n\n\"It is the central contention of this essay that an âinternational institutional turnâ is strategically necessary, politically desirable and morally urgent.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/lufeKtOp9P\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193986981547503616\nIf you, like me, plan to basically ignore Act 2 of 2020-24 while hardening your economic defenses for long haul, this is the skip-to-the-end question we actually have meaningful time to consider. The issues driving 2020 are all past the point of no-return. https://t.co/xGq98YOirX\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193981038386499584\n@TankieSanders ok tankie\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193980503545630721\n@kneelingbus @noUpside Spatial Intelligence: Architecture as a Giant Computer by @guvencozel (#refactorcamp2019 talk) https://t.co/ZgqG0SdR8s\nhttps://twitter.com/ribbonfarm/status/1193979481788047360\nIf you're fundamentally a pessimist, your task is to time the irrational-exuberance bubble epochs and short them. Permabear and permabull are both derpy futurist positions. The meaningful bets are on the transience of dark and gilded ages against a secular arc-of-history posture.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193977920491900928\nThe interesting question is predicting the lengths of the counter-cycles of the overall trend you think prevails. If you're fundamentally an optimist who thinks the arc of history is about progress overall, your task is to time the dark age lengths.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193977517788389376\nOptimism versus pessimism is a very tedious kind of debate since history has always been multiharmonic cyclic overlaid on secular trends that can be interpreted as either progress or decline.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193977338423201793\nThe entire stack of modernity is shearing. The pace-layering is hard to call. But the length of the \"dark age\" can be anything from 10 to 100 years depending on the details of the shearing dynamics. The bigger the stack refactoring you think is going on, the longer the dark age.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193976570735542272\nThink of it as this. Whatever \"this\" is, it's the result of software eating the world. The only question is what are we rhyming with here?\n\n1910s (3rd industrial revolution, mostly tech)\n\n1800s (1st industrial revolution, tech+economic)\n\n1650s:(westphalia... tech+econ+political)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193976194762326016\nIn purely technological revolutions, the interim tends to be between 1-3 decades. But when you're also simultaneously reinventing political and economic institutions, it could take much, much longer. Hence the dark-age scenario, which is more serious than people want to believe.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193975337333350400\nBut any positive dynamics are going to take longer than 10 years to have an impact. Collapse is faster than wealth-creation processes. Which is why you get busts while they race each other. Amara's Law of returns (overestimate short term/underestimate long term)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193975046148018176\nIf this seems like a doom-and-gloom thread, it isn't really. There's plenty of room for positive dynamics to be spun up in this 3 act saga. My narrow point is that these motivating \"broken system\" problems aren't solvable and won't be solved.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193974543930425344\nThis is going to be ridiculously ineffective. A bunch of people in miserable little communes larping their favorite post-apocalyptic scenarios. But it should be entertaining to watch if you happen to pick one of the minority of good ones to spectate from.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193974085258113025\n\"slug electrocuted\" is the name of somebody's ok boomer band. https://t.co/LmRmtsCsvn\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193973629907656704\n@mattlovan hahaha ok idealist\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193973410814025729\nSo we'll default to the pop-science/tech idea of what's the best Plan B, which will be most people choosing to create survivable lower-density/lower-scale communities that mitigate local impact of effectively abandoned global climate action efforts.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193973231201353728\nTo be clear this is not a good thing. Technologically, climate action is best driven by densification and energy efficiency. We're just not going to go down that route. By 2024 we'll have concluded that climate action at the scale/speed we think is necessary is impossible.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193972923431706624\nThe chances of political action fixing electoral college system in the US are low to zero. The system simply isn't that adaptable. But one thing that CAN do it is massive migration to hinterland and real reversal of the urban migration that began in the 1880s.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193972540160430080\nSo domestic migrations rewiring the political landscapes of large countries will dominate in a few years. I'll make a fun but low-confidence prediction. If we're still doing this meme thing, the top meme of 2023 will have some sort of physical mobility/migration theme.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193972126685917184\nWe've been focused on climate migration/refugees across national borders because the biggest early failures are/will be failures of weak states in the face of climate-related collapses. But in the next wave, even strong stages with functional institutions will start to unravel.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193971993176985600\nI'm calling this a colonization pattern because that is what it will be. Since the target zones are not empty or political blank slates. There have been many examples of this sort of movement in history and the sustained conflict that results between \"locals\" and migrants.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193971424727191552\nBy 2024, this mood will have organized itself in the form of entire subcultures having identified and targeted and begun moving towards \"microcolonization\" destinations (kinda like some libertarians have already targeted New Hampshire). Domestic urban pilgrim streams.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193971030227898368\nThat will trigger Act 3, the technological vote-with-feet/lifestyle choice era. There is big mood in favor of abandoning increasingly unlivable metros, but people so far don't feel the pain enough to act on *communal* out-migration fantasies. Only individual/family trickles-outs.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193970654954975232\nIn the 4 years, best case for traumatized precarity is that Warren will try and fail to deliver medicare for all, trust busting, or student loan forgiveness or UBI or anything. And the precariat will start abandoning urban economies for remote work economies.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193970106654609408\nIn 3 years it's obvious that traumatized whiteness has not actually been solved by Trumpism. It's just handed out some palliative care in the form of twitter owns. In the next year, that will \"settle\" into a permaweird limbo equilibrium, kinda like Richard Spencer.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193969764097376256\nSimpler version of the whole story:\n\n2016: Vote with memes\n2020: Vote with dollars\n2024: Vote with feet\n\nThis is assuming the core 3 tragic problems remain unsolved and nobody sees any net increase in agency/imagination.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193969097060470784\nMy ok-boomer gloss I think fits well with this theory of the political climate. If you're expecting culture war act 2, you're going to be disappointed. The culture war is over.

I'm surprised by the number of young precarious people who say they simply choose to quit health insurance when under financial stress. Also, W2 employment is a strong leakage factor that drains much of the energy out.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193962929919418368\nIt's like that trope in horror movies or thrillers where the beast/villain is down for the count, but with the last breath of life, grabs the hero by the ankle and drags him down too. gandalfbalrog.gif\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193962361381478400\n@Timber_22 Yeah possibly. I can't bring myself to take Bernie as a serious representative of anything though. His appeal seems to be the ideologically active set rather than the merely resentful superset.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193962015661772801\nNo sufficiently large constituency ever just lays down and meekly dies just because more powerful players have declared them terminal losers marked for extinction. There's always a subset willing to fight to bitter end, for at least delivering a bloody nose to the \"winners\".\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193961601285730304\nLive player/dead player is a choice to act with agency *in whatever form it is available to you*. So weak live players band together in collective action tactics as they weaken. Disenfranchised players band together in civil disobedience actions as they weaken. Etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193961159533027328\nIn general, in all these democracy riots, the systematic political miscalculation is believing live players to be dead players. Weakening players are not dead players and dead players are not extinct players. There are downcycling weapons-of-the-weak available at every stage down\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193960739184074752\n@ctbeiser Hard to see how to avoid it while staying within an \"insurance\" model if you can't mix risk populations.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193960169102663683\nConsulting Trivia #24: On Google Trends, McKinsey &gt;  BCG, Bain, except around 2012, when Bain has a spike of interest (likely due to Mitt Romney's association with it). But McKinsey appears to have suffered a decline in interest while still staying above the other two. https://t.co/ethT3Z30Ab\nhttps://twitter.com/artofgig/status/1193959699667750912\nInitially I thought healthcare would be the rallying symbol. But now I think the angries are young and healthy enough that they feel the pain of high rents far more than the cost of healthcare.

Derp momentum judo.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193952427780661248\n@spiderfoods There isnât one.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193943584572989440\n@BillSeitz Itâs all big coastal cities I think. Rent is too damn high everywhere, with SF being the worst. Just as opioid crisis was all over flyover country but worst in pockets of rust belt.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193943041637138433\nJust like in 2016, institutional elites had concluded that of course illiberalism had been permanently falsified in 1933 and ethnonationalosts couldnât aggregate into political contenders at all, except in extremist Greece/Italy form which of course couldnât happen here.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193942350327795712\nEffectively theyâve used the failure of 1910s vintage communism to convince themselves aggregate low-wealth political interests is not a contender at all in the Darwinian political arena, except in extremist Venezuelan form which of course canât happen here.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193941599278907392\nI think they all sincerely believe in some sort of âapproximate meritocracy and Darwinian competitionâ folk theory, where even if they are compassionate rather than contemptuous towards precariat, they think itâs the only way the world can work. Theyâre TINA theorists.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193940840952938502\nIâve now heard multiple very wealthy people (n ~ 6) argue that inequality is a misframing and wealthsplain the âreal problemâ to me. Theyâre missing the point. If enough people believe âinequalityâ is the right framing, it will prevail and direct the anger energy.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193940216848871424\nWhy? Because if it canât find electorally legitimate (module Russia) expression it feels is proportionate to energy, youâll get more chaotic riots not less. Think Hong Kong.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193939366126600195\nIn fact I think thatâs the likely outcome. Traumatized whiteness had the strong tailwind of electoral college mechanics to make itself heard and let off steam at White House level. \n\nTraumatized urban precariat has a strong headwind in the same department. This is bad news.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193938954774429700\n@matildepark_ Didnât seem that way 1997-2015 in the US. It was only a small, contained subproblem.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193938446764523521\nI donât think Bernie strikes the right note in representing the anger. His message is too big-tent dilutive of inequality.\n\nBut even if both lose and a more wealth-friendly candidate (Trump or one of the other Democrats) wins, the anger energy will define 2020-24.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193938052239900672\nThe âenemyâ in the inequality riots election is a Venn diagram of 3 parties: billionaires, urban NIMBYs in high value geographies, and stock-owning class that has seen nominal wealth balloon from QE-buyback loop. Warren and Yang are the paladins vying to represent the anger.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193937331830452224\nIn 2016 elites didnât realize the extent to which opioid crisis had become the rallying symbol of anger, whatever its actual importance in the larger scheme of things.\n\nIn 2020 the wealthy arenât realizing the extent to which housing/urban blight have become the rallying symbol\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193936426519236613\nIn 2016 we clung to stories about how âAmerica was already greatâ and global prosperity that simply werenât believed by activated crowd.\n\nIn 2020 they cling to stories about historic stock market highs and low unemployment that simply arenât being believed by activated crowd.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193935672588943361\nThey think itâs about defeating Warren the way we thought it was about defeating Trump. \n\nThey think âreasonableâ explanations pointing out how their mental models are misframed and the anger misdirected will defuse the anger just as in 2016.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193935080411938818\nIn 2016, clueless institutional elites like me had NO idea how much disaffected whites were directing (however inappropriately) their hulk-smash energy towards us. In many cases targeting institutions they werenât aware they were dependent on. \n\n2020 = clueless billionaires.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193933892417249280\nA tale of 3 democracy riots\n\n2016: Traumatized whiteness = ânationalismâ = loot elite and impersonal state institutions \n\n2020: Traumatized precariat = âinequalityâ = loot market institutions and large corps of the Buyback 500\n\n2024: Traumatized planet = âclimate changeâ = loot ?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193932728799903748\nItâs like how in riots over any issue, small businesses get looted because they are visible targets that vaguely rhyme with the obscure root causes of whatever is angrying up the mob. 2016-28 is going to be âriot democracyâ with the vote being about âwho gets to loot next?â\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193931425357021184\nThese problems are not solvable. Only crashable. As in a Flight 93 takeover and crashing of the institutions seen (mostly incorrectly) as responsible, without better ones ready to fill the vacuum, and without regard to actual functions. So in each case ânow you have 2 problems.â\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193930551603806211\n@grantadever It would, but I no longer feel like writing just to score wins like that. There has to be a more interesting reason than viral potential to make me play the game since Iâm bored of that level of the game.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193928993319215104\nOne reason big problems rarely actually get solved is that most people are easily bought off by being given an opportunity to be seen/heard as having the problem. Not only are they satisfied with the recognition, they resist actual solutions because the problem is their identity.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193928567391846400\nThis thread feels like it could do with a write-up, but I feel lazy about doing it. https://t.co/1JogyVbOvn\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193927858692870145\nThe gods of impossible problems drew cards in 2014 and decided to go in low-to-high order. Traumatized whiteness in 2016, middle class precarity in 2020, climate in 2024. 3-act tragedy. No problem actually solved.

Roughly PNW speed, except warm instead of cold.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193321371587117056\nThe abstract stuff above is presented here: \nhttps://t.co/CWUBpscRxx\n\nFor those averse to philosophy, I'm about to release the theory as a software specification! Not joking.\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305773910003715\n10. As for straight-up superstitions, I guess I'd criticise practitioners for their terrible exegesis! \n\nSacred texts need to be approached like literary texts first. \n\nAs a kid I lived through evangelical Christianity...\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305735024664576\n9. I think that most of this difficulty goes away if we can work out purposes that are continuous with the real teleology in the universe. For example, help things grow. Make society thrive. Bring up good children. Smash a few bureaucracies.\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305697695354882\n...And so we tend either to get stuck aspiring to unrealities, or we struggle to find something meaningful-to-us in the real universe. What is this all for? Is there any purpose that matters to me?\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305642678681600\n8. Humans are in a tough spot, because we can see what we're dealing with here, but this intellective ability to see forms doesn't help us avoid seeing fictions or intrinsically distinguish between the two. \n\n...\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305606934818816\n7. Real systems (e.g. biological organisms, particle formation, evolution of species) exhibit the same teleology, painting a picture of a universe ordered at multiple scales, toward interesting sorts of ends like working against entropy, staying out of equilibrium, &amp; growing.\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305559132340224\n6. To be ordered to some end is teleological.\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305528803328000\n4. Becoming thus functions as a modal filter, reducing being to actuality from an infinite plenitude of possible attributes. https://t.co/7pIp9TwYt2\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305505432629248\n5. To filter modally is to sacrifice a potentially infinite array of possible ways of being for an actuality. This is to say that the being *becomes ordered to* the actuality.\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305492304490496\n3. This entails that a new attribute accrues to the thing. Things actually acquire being by relating.\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305474482880512\n2. Hence, to come into real relation with something is to become part of the universe in some new respect (namely, the respect in which the things are related).\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305461757317121\nAfter all, if ends are just in our heads, then they're all \"superstitious\" and we can forget the whole enterprise.\n\nAnd now to identify teleology as a real process:\n\n1. A thing is only something if it's something to something else. https://t.co/c0ERMnlrTb\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305437774336001\nHow do we avoid purposes being mere superstitious nonsense?\n\nThis starts, for me, with the question of whether any ends are real, or if they're all just mind-dependent constructs in a universe devoid of goals or meaning. https://t.co/lbESVcjd3k\nhttps://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305417096417280\n@arlynculwick Awesome, thanks, very thought provoking thread\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193305396397494272\ntfw you realize 80% of IoT is just digital bureaucracy in a hardware device form factor.

You can become more kinds of very different person. If your life were a space mission, with different destinations being different possible versions of future you, you should probably construct better maps of becoming.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193210562655612928\nEg.\n\nWhat should you do: âfollow your passion!â\n\nHow should you do it: âLearn how to build websites, run Kickstarter campaigns, fine-tune conversion funnels, and use agile methods to iterate quickly, testing rigorously along the wayâ\n\nSee an impedance mismatch there?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193209258113818625\nWe approach the potential of the internet like a spacefaring culture of literalist astrologers. Where space missions are planned seriously at the level of âCrewed Dragon mission launched by a Falcon Heavy with 5 mission specialists and one cult-of-Mars priestâ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193208498529505280\nReason Iâm thinking about this is that under digital modernity, since ~2000, our means have vastly expanded. Thereâs a vast ecosystem of how-to instrumental education around everything from SEO and blogging to machine learning and startups. But our ends-thinking hasnât budged.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193207669340770305\nOften both get abstracted away. The Hindu ritual to launch projects (from new factories to space missions) is to crack a coconut as an offering to Ganesha in his role as obstacle-remover god (Vighneshvara). Itâs a nonspecific prayer that can later be used to explain good luck.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193206989800624128\nBut mismatch has to be very severe, and both means and ends have to be at similar levels of abstraction. One way to mitigate the dissonance is to make one more abstract. Like imagine war god being merely an ineffable presence around dirt ball rather than a guy in a palace there.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193205977681518592\nEither your means will stall at the limit of your primitive ends (youâll pray to the war god) or belief on the primitive end will fail as your means evolve (Mars gets demoted from war god to dirt ball)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193205123725479937\nThis seems absurd to me. A civilization that has mastered such an advanced means must necessarily have abandoned primitive ends along the way (at least among the principals involved in both the what and how if missions). Means-ends impedance mismatch.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193204688490905601\nCan you imagine a civilization that knows how to build rockets and spacecraft and has mastered orbital mechanics, but holds a consensus belief in astrological interpretations of the universe?

Though itâs good at spreading too. I suspect the meta commentary is 10x higher than actual use of the line in real life, which youâd expect of a good meme. https://t.co/ndYqtXcT5Q\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192832421562970118\n@nrose Now in a convenient tweet size\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192819117641871360\n@visakanv Yep.

There are acceleration stresses that warp generational relationships. The outcome depends on the mass of the generation. Low mass generations trapped between two high mass ones cannot stand the stresses of their turnings and shear off.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192714053606465537\nI demand recognition, prizes, and money for this momentous discovery. Strauss-Howe merely did some Keplerian curve fitting. I have discovered a Newtonâs laws type dynamic governing their theory of 4 turnings.

That episode starts with Jerry giving them the benefit of doubt on relevance, but ends with whatâs effectively an âok mandelbaumsâ punchline.

The adversary turns into a lame duck due to mortality, no matter how much nominal power they have. The NPV of their power declines to âmostly harmlessâ.\n\nIt will happen to Xâs, Ms, Zs in turn.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192696753989931008\nI think Tyler misreads this. While heâs right that Boomers are viewed as a force of nature, âOk Boomerâ signals agency to fellow Ms/Zs rather than impotence.

The trick there is to lead with your chin as you go side to side, keeping head vertical. Some people simply can't do this one.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192556838874599424\n@nwilliams030 No, sounds like a @visakanv type of thing\n\nMy personal dissection of the head wobble when people ask me to teach them is to imagine your head oscillating about an axis going through the nose front to back. So the chin and top of head move in opposite direction.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192556156339666944\n@nwilliams030 Interestingly, both the movements most associated with Indians, the head wobble and the side-to-side head thing, are also stylized gestures in classical dance forms... so you could generalize your point about indescribable movement patterns to entire cultures.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192554584696246272\n@nwilliams030 this was the first thing I saw that made me realize this was a thing https://t.co/Wt9YleHWVl\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192551806749925376\nokay ongoing list of people who move indescribably  because at one point they were formally trained as dancers\nhttps://twitter.com/nwilliams030/status/1192551543133757441\n@nolangray_ ok boomer :D\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192543757016522752\n@EvanBThomas Ah got it, you're anchoring to the intentionality-lock aspect of inability to procrastinate\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192543642746937344\nTime abundance is not like other kinds of abundance, since there is a non-stationary flow and an asymmetry to it. You can't store time the way you can surpluses of other sorts. All you can do is tweak your intentions towards things \"filling\" time from \"must do\" to \"can ignore\"\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192543201833259008\n@EvanBThomas hmm... and concentrinate means... going towards a concentric circle, so towards peripheral vision or something?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192542815768563713\n@EvanBThomas what's wrong with concrastinate? and what's the construction there of concentrinate...?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192541343081365504\n@tdoggyholhol ð¤ \"belonging to tomorrow\" apparently https://t.co/GsXLX1LdCv\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192541099992027136\nIf you're middle class or above, time is almost always an abundant quantity, so long as you're willing to sneak off. What creates the sense of insufficient time is the idea that everything on your to-do list is a must-do. You're not short of time, you're long on commitment.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192540754234630144\nConcrastrinate: the opposite of procrastinate. Always doing the most efficient/effective next thing on an endless to-do list, and never sneaking off to work on stuff you're not supposed to be working on.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192540115203055616\nThe value of the stock goes up and down as the clarity and agency go up and down through use and abuse. Successful concepts ossify and attract growing abuse, creating disruption opportunities. As a memester, you have to watch the meme markets for \"startup\" opps basically.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192533377699598337\nImplicit in this model is that conceptual meaning is not something that evolves from fluid usages and eventually \"arrives\" by landing in a dictionary or other canonical reference work, like an IPO. Conceptual meanings are like companies with stocks on a meaning stock market.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192533103736020992\nI'd like to try and teach semantic disruption skills at some point, but I don't yet have a clear sense of what kind of preparedness you'd need to pick up on this. It's a bit like being a meme VC, knowing when a concept is right for disruption and that an angle on it is working\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192532699346395136\nHow do you know your attempt at semantic disruption is working? Two signs:\n\nSocial proof: people resonate wit your sense of usage. They train on, and add to, your use instances.\n\nMaterial proof: navigating with that concept yields better-than-random results, ie it finds agency\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192532208042381312\nMost of the terms people are suggesting in the replies: community, agile, data-driven, fit this pattern. They are reifications in search of a locus of agency that may or may not exist, and you won't know till you try to \"land\" the concept on a pattern of agency that seems to work\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192531704365211648\nThere are banal things you can do that alter time experience. I'm not even talking drugs or base jumping. I'm talking stuff like drinking coffee or going to sleep. Those alterations are not to bare-metal time proper, but to the lowest level reification that offers some agency.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192531256841363456\nOne I'm working on right now is \"temporality\". Why not just say \"time\"? Because \"time\" offers no agency unless you know how to travel at relativistic speeds or shrink yourself down to sub-Planck quantum levels. \"Temporality\" is a way to pick out locus of agency just above \"time\"\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192530511811362816\nA good heuristic for picking out this condition is to apply John Wannamaker's observation \"I know half my advertising works, I just don't know which half.\"\n\nThis is why \"marketing\" is hard. The semantic noise induced by the illegibility of the agency sought.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192530084814454784\nTake for example, the word \"strategy\". It attempts to create agency at higher levels of abstraction in thinking about conflict. The agency involved in pulling a trigger is obvious. The agency involved in moving tokens around on a map in a war-room is not.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192529751824429056\nA common pattern I've noticed in terms that are vulnerable to this pattern of concept creep and semantic decay is that they pick out attempts to create agency out of reifications, and there is some actual agency there. Just hard to pick out, acquire, and exercise well.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192529494680014848\n@ThuggyPinch interesting to you personally, in the sense of triggering a fertile positive feedback loop of curiosity and exploration in a certain direction\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192527068673630208\nBut the BIG trick is to not reveal what you're doing until/unless it actually catches on, and people start saying things like \"sociopath in the gervais principle sense\". It's like a test of success in the form of taking a word-stock into private equity, then re-IPOing it.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526786812231681\nMy book Tempo (which grew out of my postdoc project, which in turn kinda grew out of my false-start project with my buddy to reconstruct \"strategy\") attempts something similar. It is built around a somewhat idiosyncratic, but not too heterodox core sense of \"strategy\".\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526535527301120\nIt turned into a shtick for me at some point, and is probably the conceptual basis of how I do a lot of my meme-inception type writing. Eg. Gervais Principle is based on trying to disrupt the word \"sociopath\"\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526260980703232\nThe aim is to almost achieve a semantic disruption of sorts. If the \"market\" for a term is all the ways it is used, arranged in some sort of tag cloud, with a bad/bureaucratic vacuous center, you disrupt by picking a more meaningful thing on the margins.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526019401355266\nThe private definition should be chosen not for Grand Unified Theory potential of the term's history, but pick out and exaggerate an elegant new core in the connotation cloud. It's like caricature mixed with rebasing (in the sense of picking a new origin for a coordinate system)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192525773187366912\nThe trick to the clean-up exercise is to avoid the temptation to rigorously analyze the history of the concept and propose a cleaned up definition. Thar be legalism and bureaucracy. \n\nInstead, just impose a *private* definition on yourself and stick to it with discipline.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192525360442695680\nBack around 2002, I had a friend in grad school who was studying law and philosophy of language. He was also a Navy vet. We proposed a little project (didn't really get off the ground) to analyzing the concept creep of \"strategy\" over the decades and reconstruct it more cleanly\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192525053016952832\nA good hack to find interesting ideas to work on is to start with a word that seems to pick out an important concept, but has been rendered annoyingly vacuous by abusive overextension. Examples: strategy, meaning, irony. Other examples?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192524260209643520\nConsulting Trivia #22: Google Trends reveals \"future of work\" had a peak of interest around 2004 (the earliest data is available, followed by a decade of lower interest, followed by a 5-year ramp to 2004 levels by 2019.

If camp is âfailed seriousnessâ (Susan Sontag) postcamp is failed irony transcendence.\n\nThe misreading of cynicism as irony is revealing. There is pure cynicism, and cynicism as a reductive perception of irony. Postcampies cant tell the two apart.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192477924114362368\nMost attempts at transcending irony seem to fail in ironic ways. Mostly itâs ineffectively reactionary sincerity in response to cynicism, rather than irony. A response that appears to not actually be sensitive to irony in the first place.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192477441454829568\nMore examples.

If you think about it, it's like solving a small Y2K type problem every couple of years, by adding a month.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190355051409076224\nBut solar calendars despite being harder to technologically track, are more useful, since harvest cycles etc. follow solar patterns, and not many practically important things track lunar time (night-time safety?)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190354801063673856\nThe other alternative is to measure day length and know when the longest or shortest day passes. This requires minute-level precision in sub-day timekeeping, which is actually quite hard even with high quality hourglasses etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190354191950082048\nTemporal collisions also reveal history. The reason most ancient cultures used lunar or lunisolar calendars is that it's actually hard to estimate solar year directly. You have to precisely track solstices (\"sun standing still\") which means keeping daily noontime elevation logs\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190353782816698369\nAnyone have any other such examples of temporality collisions/resonances/dissonances?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190351937369063424\nIn general, you are rarely made conscious of just how arbitrary calendar time is.

The Corportation Raj era is drawing to a close.

It had the same level of exploitation but an added layer of hypocritical idealism. The difference between the Imperial Raj and Company Raj in India was that the the company era people didnât pretend (as much) to be noble idealists.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189944501164359680\nTheresa precedent though. Colonialism was a 2-phase affair. Phase 1, roughly 1600-1800, was corporations land-grabbing the new superhuman agency of new European transportation tech (sailing). Phase 2 was nations building empires (1800-WW2). It is debatable which was worse.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189943785045626881\nI have no suggestions. Constitutional governance doesnât seem capable of the kind of agility necessary here. California is trigger happy with too many amendments and it doesnât seem to help because itâs not actually driven by imaginative reconstitutional thinking.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189943064682356736\nThatâs why we have this weird disconnect with 2 tracks of dissonant political conversations. \n\nTrack 1: âregulate big tech with bizarre constraints that look like bullwhips on steering wheelsâ\n\nTrack 2: âspin wheels on too-hard-to-update fundamentals like free speechâ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189935149179236352\nGoogle for example is âsuperhuman power of search and free knowledgeâ and treating it as an obvious extension to DCâs or EUâs authority is misguided. It needs an expanded-consent v]conversation, which is pre-regulation, at the level of something like a constitution amendment.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189934237928943616\nOne reason corporations tend to win the early land grab for the ungovermed territory is that people equate âregulationâ with âexpanded governance under existing consentâ rather than ârenegotiated consentâ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189933722667122689\nHereâs a thought. \n\nWhen human agency increases, andceverybody becomes say 10% more superhuman, the expanded agency isnât automatically grandfathered into old social contract. It creates new ungoverned territory that requires an expanded consent-of-governed addendum.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189933213549858816\nSIO research scholar Shelby Grossman has a thread walking through the country-specific findings here, including visuals.

Reality just happens to be vastly more noisy and confusing than weâve been prepared to admit, and believing in untruths a lot less dangerous than weâve been led to believe.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189765864142200832\nReports of the death of reality have been highly exaggerated. People enjoy pretending to believe in it more than they actually do, so they can get all dramatic about it and shock people by declaring âpost truthâ or whatever.\n\nPost institutional consensus is not post truth.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189765162619662337\nLike flat earth.

They enjoy a disbelief moat.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189763300675866624\nNone of these crisis commentators ever shows up at a church breathlessly reporting on the far more unbelievable belief systems being performed with much more literal belief inside. \n\nPossibly the difference is that crackpot theories are clearly in the zone of falsifiability.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189762205119500288\nIn general, I think the people who do the hand-wringing âreality is brokenâ agonizing are actually part of the kayfabe. Overstating the case so strongly underlines how weak the belief actually is. Compared to traditional religion for example, itâs like 1% as serious.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189761192144723968\n@string_literal How long does the ding last? If a single 4-star can cost you weeks of $150 dips, then it is correctly reserved for seriously dangerous/crazy drivers who shouldnât be on the road at all. Thatâs basically the only case Iâd do a 4 for â if I think that person shouldnât be driving\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189760448960163841\nThereâs a sort of conscious bullshitting going on there. When tv shows do gimmicky episodes on ufo-hunter themes they tend to portray the characters as unironic literalist farce versions of Mulder on X-Files. I suspect the real ones are basically like comic book nerds.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189759342934839296\nWhat do you call belief states underlying this kind of kayfabe larping? Itâs clearly not literal, or ordinary irony. But itâs also overstating the case to call it delusional. A sort of serious unjoke. Performative chindogu?

You get sucked into half serious quasi belief. Even we scorpios are not immune.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188207684069154816\n@APXHard Sounds heartless I realize, but making them abstract wards of an impersonal welfare system is a cure worse than the disease, since it is the excuse for creating most of the state.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188205994746114048\n@APXHard Without specifying to whom a particular life has value, it becomes an empty aspiration. You could perhaps treat your UBI as an initial and declining subsidy, like a rolling book advance. Badly disabled etc will need to be explicitly adopted by people/institutions who care.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188205516977127424\n@APXHard But the seller has an incentive to ensure transactions are logged since each transaction compounds future tax share. So only the desperate will accept black market transactions.\n\nI donât like âhuman life has valueâ as a design condition though I like the sentiment.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188204670172291072\n@APXHard Iâm against explicit allocation. Everything drafts off actual transactions.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188202790914445312\n@scottomelianuk The âtax shareâ is basically equivalent to continuous IPO. Like supercharged bootstrapping. If you sell well, you get more of the share of taxes from ALL previous customers. Thatâs your capital.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188201254800875520\nThe modern economy hasnât had a design refresh since approximately the 1600s. Weâve just twiddled some knots and settings.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188200679145238528\nA lot of this is probably wildly flawed but the base insight Iâm trying to work out is ânot all planet scale emergent computing systems are equally powerful and expressiveâ\n\nPre-modern global economy = 1\nModern = 3\nClimate system = 5\nBiological evolution = 6\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188200404955226113\nAfaict even the wildest blockchain or blockchain-like schemes donât go this far. Itâs a weird design, effectively turning the economy into a Hebbian deep learning system or something.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188199095942275072\nFlatten market governance and make it coextensive with the market itself. Kill the gods of âinterest ratesâ and a financial market system that sits like a heaven above the earthly basic transactional goods/services system.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188198602885087232\nNot just brand equity, but regular equity could get absorbed by this scheme. You wouldnât need a stock or bond market. Every transaction would be an implicit stock/bond tx as well. No need to bolt on a bottleneck long-term memory capital market onto amnesiac transaction market.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188198087656800256\nThis scheme would need a lot more computation per transaction btw, and effectively perfectly eidetic transactional memory. That alone inspires confidence it would be smarter. Price becomes a richer signal, with a past and future. Todayâs economy is kinda amnesiac.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188197447798939648\nThis also sort of kills advertising. Current income sort of translates directly into brand equity that makes future income cheaper.. while moving it from private property to public commons. Lean into commoditization.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188196704580849664\nSo current direct spending drives future redistribution. With a shifting weight and forgetting/discounting factor. Eventually more and more of everybodyâs income comes from the redistribution rather than direct. Private morphs smoothly into public utilities.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188196173028347904\nSo hereâs an idea. Set aside a fixed tax fraction on my dollars. Every time I spend a dollar buying something from you, it strengthens a weight. My tax fraction is then periodically distributed among my transactional counterparties in proportion to the weights of transaction.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188194902691069952\nLetâs call the memetic equivalent of Gaia... Maia! \n\nSelfish Meme = Selfish Maia\n\nHow do you translate this refactoring into an economic idea? Trick might be to map transactions to reproduction rather than feeding.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188193871391412224\nYou are a holographic model of Gaia effectively. Inclusive fitness - Darwinian competition between competing Gaias, not genes, individuals, groups or species. Selfish Gene = Selfish Gaia theory.\n\nA more powerfully expressive post-capitalism economics would do the same for memes.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188192978382180352\nIn genetics, every individual organismâs genome is a map of relationship to the entire biosphere. If you pass on your genes directly or indirectly, you also pass on 99% genes of chimpanzee genes, 80% of lobster genes etc (look up actual numbers... theyâre in the ballpark)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188192449904046080\nIâm not saying invent tax systems that model philanthropy. Philanthropic intentions are generally reactionary, tribal, worse than kin-selfishness. But it has the right kind of expressiveness of inclusion relationship: to people, whales, climate, space programs, whatever.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188191733646934018\nThis is very low resolution. It has little to no connection to my actual pattern of relationship behaviors. And there are mediating agents between me and tax beneficiaries who distort things further.\n\nLook at patterns of philanthropy for a sense of actual felt relationship.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188191221723742208\nTaxes model inclusive fitness coarsely. If I earn a dollar, pay $0.15 in federal taxes, $0.15 in state income and sales taxes, and $0.05 in local taxes, retaining $0.65 in consumed/saved value, all citizens are like ~second cousins, fellow state citizens are ~first cousins etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188190465226461184\nIf you look at history, âbusinessâ effectively evolved out of cultural kin selection. Powerful clans looking out for themselves against monarchs and peasant masses etc. Capitalism just shrank the unit from &gt;3 generations extended family to &lt;3 generation nuclear.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188189348182687744\nDefinitions in case youâre unfamiliar with them. Personal and inclusive are ways of coupling relational identity and behavior. Inclusive fitness (selfish gene) is more accurate than personal fitness (selfish person or kinship group)\n\nhttps://t.co/h8CXlpOfYa https://t.co/OvkAcpEsMs\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188188570227331072\nAfter napping on it, I have a theory of what ails capitalism: it is not Darwinian enough.\n\nThe âselfishâ motive in Adam Smith corresponds to personal fitness rather than inclusive fitness. Taxation is a crude and insufficiently precise mechanism to add inclusive fitness back in. https://t.co/JWLNC8egy3\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188187274455896064\nIâm fundamentally sympathetic to capitalism but if I had to make a critique, it would be: it institutionalizes an unrealistically cynical view of human nature, rendering idealism unreasonably ineffective and self-defeating\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188167650544779264\n@vgr My first book radically changed everything, but also nothing.

The tight/agile iterative feedback loops of social media writing are very bad for book-scale writing. If you use them you end up writing what reads like a series of blog posts/essays, begging the question.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187894784104390659\nThe biggest internal reason to try and write a book is to challenge yourself to hunt down a much larger idea than social media allows. Books allow you to aim for intellectual outer space. At the moment, social media only allows you to achieve low-altitude atmospheric flight.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187893558771998720\nAlmost any specific external effect or outcome of a book I can bring myself to care about, I can immediately think of like 6 better ways to achieve through much easier and more fun ways through blog posts etc. A book is usually the worst medium for most kinds of actual impact.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187893079816032256\nOne of the effects of being an internet-native writer, with enough success to foster a degree of arrogance, is that \"book\" motivations that work for trad writers don't work for you.

More a passport.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187885702307991553\nIn my case, my only book qua book, Tempo, had following external effects:\n\n1.

Itâs tempting to take old verse-wisdom and retcon Twitter onto them, but thatâs wrong. Especially in India with palm life scribing being so expensive, these were super overwrought careful thoughts, not throwaway shitposting.

You could write a 250 page book that actually has an idea of that scale, or you could just fluff out what should be a twitter thread with filler. For too many dumb gatekeepers thereâs no difference.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187814635426045952\n@fortelabs Look at digital native things. Authoring a consciously crafted warren of interlinked threads like @visakanv is not a case of new media eating and commoditizing old media. Itâs a case of new media uncommoditizing itself out of a commodity default layer. \n\nItâs an expensive signal.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187814008591540224\nVery productive week.

So to believe in it is a leap of faith\n\nThis is where I end up disagreeing with experienced meditators\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187799729461022722\n@vgr Sometimes I feel I have stepped into the wrong trouser leg of time\nhttps://twitter.com/BravoJohnson5/status/1187798551117434880\nBut I think this flawed. I think in some sense there is no territory. Only maps.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187797832272494592\nIt is tempting to think of there being a ground truth cultural reality with different must-inhabit temporalities being co-extensive and nonrivalrous imperative coverings of it. Many maps for different journeys, one territory. Any journey that is not prohibited is mandatory.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187797483029532672\nKanye is just an example. The general principle is that consensus reality is actually dissensus garden of forking paths, but unlike bitcoin, there is no longest-chain-wins rule. There is no protocol force ensuring universal consensus. So you get divergence. Multitemporality.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187796646093942784\n@ankurrsharma Paradigmatic example of a must-consume\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187795583106351104\nI saw a guy living\n\nNot reading must-reads\nNot listening to must-listens\nNot watching must-watches\nNot knowing must-knows\nNot suffering atemporality\n\nJust living in his own timeline, like a psychopath\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187795298225016832\n@swimming_blerd I agree, it is 100% dubious and I donât actually believe it, but thatâs the point. Historicity is a construct that a) you can opt-in to b) has no pr9vileged version.\n\nItâs more than popular appeal, but falls short of an absolute temporality (which I argue cannot exist)\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187794558144241670\nIâve never knowingly listened to Kanye (though I take my musical friends at their word that Iâm missing something historic), but unlike the law of gravity, or hard edged laws of justice system, the consequences of not obeying the must-listen law are not as clear. But they exist.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187794101510402050\nOne key idea behind my multitemporality thesis is that it is possible to not read must-reads, not listen to must-listens, etc and still stay not alive, but in time. Ie experience a coherent temporality and be in history. \n\nIe there is no privileged necessary trunk temporality\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187793296694726657\n@swimming_blerd I think thatâs a grey zone thing. Popularity is weak social proof of potential historicity, but some things embody actual historicity, where past and future of X donât make sense without X. Memes that flood the meme pool.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187792687077851137\nTo not listen to say John Legend is merely a matter of taste/cultural choice\n\nTo not listen to Kanye is to forgo an entire timeline, a way of being in time\n\nTo the extent you think music is a necessary strand of history, it is sitting out *the* timeline. Consensus reality trunk.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187792194142269440\nBut back to sat Kanye West as a must-listen. It isnât authoritarian, and itâs totally opt-in to Nation of Ye, but there is a certain force of necessity there nevertheless. It is a precondition for participation in a temporality; a way of being in historical time.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187791444926332928\nIn the US it is mostly must-recognize but only subset have memorized the whole thing. Itâs twice as long, almost as archaic (not a dead language but older English), and most ceremonial performances require standing but not sing-along. In part because itâs a harder melody to sing.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187790988300828672\nA national anthem is a good edge case. In India, it is short, in Sanskrit (so most of us donât actually understand it), and universally memorized. A true must-know. And hammered in because you must actually sing it frequently in schools. Not just stand for it.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187790155341414400\nDivine right of kings and absolute rule of divine law produce versions of deterministic agency closure (forbidden+compulsory = everything) via cults of personality or legalism.\n\nCultural determinism is an attempt to manufacture that imperative force.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187789558697488384\nIn what sense is a must read a must read? Or a must-watch a must-watch? Or a must-listen a must-listen?\n\nOr to generalize, a must-obey cultural consumption/knowledge imperative. \n\nIt is a version of authoritarian âwhat isnât prohibited is compulsoryâ but an unusual kind\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187788757778362369\nI want to connect this thread on political philosophy of free will to cultural consumption choices that seem ânecessaryâ in some ways.

You can make choices, there will be wrong choices in proportion to knowledge, and you canât be held responsible by those who know better.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187758559469043712\n@APXHard This principle says if you know everything about a state S, all actions but 1 will be impossible, and the 1 action will be unavoidable. So no choice.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187757810034991105\nClosing this gap = exercise of raw power and hiding anything whose appearance cannot be made to conform to omniscience/omnipotence posture. \n\nInterestingly this always requires totalitarian human rulers. Totalitarian rule systems alone canât maintain the appearance of totality.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187757266616737792\nIn practice both prohibitions and compulsions constrain behavior down to a resolution threshold of indifference. That threshold is where gap between world perception and claimed complete knowledge of the world is small enough that you can credibly claim omniscience/omnipotence\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187756323577815041\n@KentBeck Thereâs 4 volumes!\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187755438604836866\nYou can only be free in proportion to the ignorance you acknowledge\n\nEverything you claim as knowledge will force you to act or run into a constraint\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187755206819246081\nOr equivalently, freedom to act or not act in non-totalitarian systems is a function of an explicit procedural accommodation of formal ignorance. \n\nâItâs neither forbidden, nor compulsoryâ = âwe donât knowâ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187754681700765697\nSo there is no such thing as a pure observer view of the world. If you know something you must either act on it or be actively constrained from acting by law.\n\nHuman totalitarianism is a sort of illusory physics based on a manufactured illusion of perfect knowledge.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187754116249870337\nThe general idea is agency closure over a perfect knowledge condition. There is no non-instrumental knowledge. Everything that is known can drive action, and all action not prohibited by law must happen.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187753306325602305\nIn the physics interpretation it leads to the sum over histories method and many worlds interpretation. What happens is a function of everything that *could* happen. So there is no room for free will at the multiverse level of quantum description. Every path must be in the sum.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187752880133947393\nThinking about the rule of totalitarianism \"Everything not forbidden is compulsory.\" (T. H. White) which Gell-Mann ported to physics. \n\nScience of Discworld 2 states it as the principle of societies run on tribal law.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187751885790302208\n@vgr Iâm optimizing my frivolous stuff tbh; I have aesthetic blogs/collections of images that Iâm a bit obsessive about curating and perfecting.\nhttps://twitter.com/s_r_constantin/status/1187750070550237186\nMeek or strong is almost irrelevant.

There's got to be a better way to let the mentally ill, diseased, physically disabled population live as best as they can without the rest of us effectively treating them like literal garbage to sweep-up.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186019526560735232\nYou could construct a ratio of some sort: (area you control)*(number of people who you would keep out under any circumstances)/(area controlled by people who wouldn't let you in under any circumstances).\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186018054901133312\nWe are all simultaneously prisoners and prison wardens. There are people who we wouldn't let past our exclusivity claim borders under any circumstances, and places we would't be allowed in under any circumstances. Without threat of violence in both cases.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186017756635811840\nLike, I'd probably let in almost anyone credibly claiming a bathroom emergency. \n\nMy \"prisoners\" would be people I wouldn't let in under any circumstances besides violence. So likely seriously unraveled/unhygienic homeless people, diseased people, people who seem threatening.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186017279760187393\nLike, I have a nice apartment in a big metro. The cops and firemen and landlord have some rights to bust in without my permission. With respect to everybody else in the world, I'd let in almost anybody under particular conditions. So who do I \"imprison\" by claiming the apartment?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186016728376954881\nGuesting/hosting protocols and reciprocal roaming rights are where the meaning of \"human\" is legislated via de facto patterns of mutual recognition of roaming rights. Anyone you wouldn't allow in to territory you claim exclusively is in some mild way, your prisoner.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186016268857430016\nTerritorial claims are entirely about restricting the roaming range of others. Territorialists would scream bloody murder if you told them \"fine you can have territory X so long as you never leave it\"\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186015828631683072\nIn a way, nativism, property rights, and other forms of territoriality are a red herring. People with power to claim exclusive power over territory X generally have a roaming range FAR bigger than X. If you have a US passport and enough $, your roaming range is most of the world.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186015537052045313\n@BillSeitz I think we're starting to find out\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186014952047333376\nPrisoners, homeless people swept back periodically into \"bad\" blocks, refugees, developing country people penned into weak-passport zones, etc etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186014840831111168\nTo first order, the degree to which your humanity is acknowledged by societal consensus is almost perfectly modeled by the territorial extent through which you can move pretty freely. I think this is why I react so strongly against walls/borders.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186014605102862336\nThe default strategy of cities seems to be pretty much sweep them up periodically and restrict them to \"bad\" blocks so they're out of sight and not much of a problem for others.  It's a sort of de facto concentration camp strategy. There's no guards or barbed wire, but that's it\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186013723904733185\nLike I see cops/social workers occasionally step in to sort of bundle them up and move them along, but it is unclear to me how you even deal with people in this state. The cruel thing to do seems to be to institutionalize them in some bad under-resourced place.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186013395373264896\nConcretely, there's an old woman outside the starbucks I'm at who is shaking, clearly in mental distress, kinda ranting, and sitting in a pile of what I can only consider garbage mixed with some food\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186012974160306176\n@rcdaut I'm looking for a word or phrase to describe the appearance/behavior, not diagnosis. Like \"loss of composure\" is a much milder normal thing that you see that's line 2/10 on the spectrum where this is 9/10\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186012694949838848\nLike a normal homeless person in possession of faculties might have hygiene problems and cart around stuff that's sad, but it's a sane way of being in a bad state. I can see myself doing the same in that situation. But this other mode... they're in an alt reality\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186012261879443456\nTheir material possessions play a role: they are kinda surrounded by a pile of basically garbage mixed with useful food/possessions and they can't seem to tell the difference. This might be the most clear symptom. A sort of hoarding syndrome except indiscriminate and disorganized\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186011578757345280\nI'm blanking on a word to describe the unraveling of personhood you see in some homeless people in the grips of some sort of drug/non-drug psychosis. Uncoordinated movements, incoherent affect of terror/discomposure, loss of control of bodily function... what word would you use?\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186011194340937728\n@staticsteven My point is, people would devote 100% of their available attention to content they pay (or is freemium supported by other subscribers) for IF they could find content that meets their needs. They turn to lower-quality ad-supported stuff because they can't.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186009051693346816\nI think the problem is actually going to be a vector misalignment problem. Even if you magically increased the amount of content, it wouldn't be aligned with what advertisers want to sell. But it would still quench the demand, so it would kill advertising from the demand side\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186007380988792832\nI don't think I've seen this point made before, that there is actually a quantifiable demand for quality content for which the size of the advertising market is actually a near-perfect proxy.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186006927576186880\nWhy wouldn't ALL attention move from ads to subscriptions? Only reason I can think of is: available attention (audience hunger) and demand for it (advertiser hunger) far exceeds the amount of quality content available to catalyze it\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186006369918259200\nThe unit economics of \"content\" are finally becoming clear 20 years in. \n\n500 views, monetized via subscription at 10% at say $2 per view, with a 10% commission to the platform is $1\n\n500 views, monetized via ads at say $2 cpm is also $1. \n\nBut one of these is a MUCH smarter $\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186005944867545088\nWhen I compare my experience on teachable and substack to say youtube, twitter and facebook, it strikes me that \"creator-centric\" is simply a better experience all around. Absolutely the only reason NOT to do that is to trade off quality for high-volume/low-yield advertising.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186005001744707584\nUpdate on this thread for all the people who were interested. Artist Serafin Alvarez from Barcelona just shared this video of portals with me. https://t.co/9Vet4wSpIp https://t.co/do7pi4HK7C\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185977694372020224\n@ben_mathes At best you have constitutive laws, like brookâs law or the idea that strongly typed languages are safer etc.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185963429892251649\n@ben_mathes My point is it is a secondary âinteriorâ phenomenology, not a forcing functions defining the bounding box of constraints. Ie, there are no fundamental constraint laws there. In engineering you have quantum limit, in math you have P=NP, in bicycle/ux you have 2 eyes/10 fingers\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185963094788304896\n@ben_mathes Individual languages may not be within their paradigm, but across languages with overlapping capability? Thatâs clearly undeterdetermined. You can pick a 1000 ways to output âhello worldâ and thereâs no âright answerâ\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185953147849592834\n@ben_mathes The bicycle part tends to be underrated because itâs had such limited scope until recently. I think of bicycle=UX as a placeholder art-science, kinda like alchemy or astrology before chemistry/astronomy. But with VR/AR, voice etc, itâs coming into its own as applied neuroscience\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185952345814732801\n@ben_mathes Mathematical aesthetics perhaps? Language design is underdetermined by all 3 elements (math, engineering, bicycle), thatâs why thereâs so much diversity there.\n\nBicycle is a good observation. In future it might just be applied neuroscience/biology.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185951406341025794\nWhen the signal gets noisy and processing it gets expensive, most people go tribal to cope but a few turn into asshole free riders arbitraging across tribal epistemologies.\n\nWe should call this truth hacking.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185814658764066816\n@Archivd Oh yeah that too!\n\nMemetic signal processing for a fake news era\n\nWonder how many such adaptive techniques have emerged in the wild. \n\nMost take a decent social network to use though.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185813114773618688\n@vgr Using Cunningham's Law as a kind of echolocation device.\nhttps://twitter.com/Archivd/status/1185812736195715072\n@davidmanheim Thatâs right, free riding ftw\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185810899182833664\nI donât really read ambiguous news and opinion directly anymore.

Teaching intro fluid mechanics or linear algebra was mildly useful as a refresher, but basically not fun. It was service work. Designing and teaching my one 600 level course otoh was a huge amount of fun.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1184989245343064065\nThe last few @artofgig issues have definitely been in this category.

Ideally both.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1184988332209496065\nI get now why âservice journalismâ is called that. As a writer, itâs basically unfulfilling so you genuinely have to bring a sense of service to the task to care enough to write half-decent things.

Accept a snails pace of further growth tracking shared understandings or move faster with less sharing but higher risk of deeper understanding being wrong. This is solipsistic dark growth.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183487555318116352\nBy the time you get to some version of the species leading edge of self-understandings (thereâs no consensus but it takes till around 40 to get to any of the edge nodes) youâre acutely aware that the line of scrimmage between us and universe  wonât move much more in your lifetime\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183486919943933952\nHuman understanding of the universe grows at a fairly slow rate, even with exponentially growing production of raw knowledge.

Thatâs fulfillment rather than dark growth.

Some aspects of parenting and grand parenting and teaching have that but it is kinda narrow.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183473667981770752\nThatâs kinda what 40+ life can feel like except that a) most people donât even notice that there IS a different life stage b) a lot of people actually get confused and start thinking they should be actually taking tests and worrying about grades like theyâre still in school\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183445755521990656\nImagine if at 30 you had 16 year olds constantly asking you about what grade you got on the test, taking your reticence to mean you got a bad grade because they donât get that school ends and thereâs a different life beyond,  and judging/shaming you loudly for not studying harder\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183445250380951552\nI have this growing impatience with the framing of the 40+ life experience as âslowly failing youthâ unless youâre in the minority that stays on an obvious extension of the under-40 script.

It means growth has gone past healthy solipsism horizon. Theyâre living life on their own terms.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183438957834465283\nEmpirically people donât really seem to grow much after 40. Maybe 1 in 10 will adopt a truly different mindset. Maybe 1 in 100 will develop a new life-shaping ability (not a hobby). Maybe 1 in 1000 will take on a fundamentally leveled-up Act 2 that will top Act 1.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183437518638682112\nOnly when you compress solid hydrogen a lot - like near the core of Jupiter - does it become important that the molecules aren't completely round.

Kinda like suddenly getting into religion late in life does.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183109442373484545\n@Aelkus @literalbanana I recall in William James' Variety of Religious Experiences, he starts with \"the religion of healthy-mindedness\" (basically normies with no deep spiritual leanings or introspective tendencies) and dismisses them quickly to move on to more \"interesting\" angsty varieties.\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183108442422034432\n@Aelkus @literalbanana it's only invalid if you think somehow extreme depressive angst or existential nausea is in some way a more \"authentic\" response... it is certainly an interesting response, arguably more interesting than dull estate planning, but I am not convinced it is more authentic\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183107814006243328\n@thejaymo thanks... it was a high-risk personal interest project that I basically had zero expectations of anyone else really getting any value out of\nhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183107357288484864\n@literalbanana @Aelkus Subnormies read heidegger, normies try to figure out how to game taxes on their 401k and transfer property to kids in the sneakiest way possible.

For Foursquare, you could build a cluster, or diagram, showing how aÂ [single profile](https://mashable.com/2009/03/16/foursquare/)Â of the startup led toÂ [one major brand partnership](https://mashable.com/2009/10/22/bart-and-foursquare/), which led to additional coverage by a couple of blogs, which led to aÂ [proliferation of other brand partnerships](https://mashable.com/2010/02/08/foursquare-media-deals/), more media coverage, aÂ [Forrester study](https://mashable.com/2010/07/27/foursquare-marketing-study/)Â and news that the social gaming service had surpassed theÂ [3 million user mark](https://mashable.com/2010/08/29/foursquare-3-million-users/). The story you could tell with this kind of diagram would be much more comprehensive than a chronological list of links to articles about Foursquare milestones; it could also help you draw connections about who tends to provide early coverage in the space, what news sources marketers read and how technology and/or marketing trends gather momentum on the web.\nThe tool isn't limited to just linking articles and illustrating trends, however â see thisÂ [Periodic Table Trail](http://trailmeme.com/trails/The_Periodic_Table_Trail), for example, which takes advantage of the app's ability to add tags and commentary to each box on the diagram.\nTrailmeme is still in an early stage of development (the startup is still \"twist[ing] and turn[ing] in search of a business model,\" founder Venkatesh Rao tells us), but the team behind it has created both a web-based app andÂ [Wordpress plugin](http://www.trailmeme.com/tools/WordPress)Â that enable users to create and explore these kinds of diagrams, as well as aÂ [Firefox toolbar](http://www.trailmeme.com/tools/firefox_toolbar)Â andÂ [bookmarklet](http://www.trailmeme.com/tools/bookmarklet)Â to tag content you eventually want to diagram.\nSoon, the startup hopes to branch out into enterprise knowledge management. Rao explains that employees spend a lot of time hunting down information on poorly-organized intranets. \"If trails can make even a small dent in that wasted time, the productivity gains will be huge,\" he imagines. \"And if organizing information becomes a fun and creative visual activity instead of a bureaucratic burden, the problem of knowledge management will simply go away,\" he says.\nTrailmeme's ultimate mission is to help denizens of the web overcome information overload or, as Rao likes to call it, information anxiety. \"The real-time web is great, but it has us constantly living at the microsecond level, tweeting furiously on our smartphones,\" he says. \"We donât dare step back, because we are afraid weâll miss something. The way to overcome that fear is to have the big-picture tools that allow you to step back and look at the web at different scales, see things in context and not always be clicking the squeakiest tweeted link. A trail can reveal that the most important article on a topic is a year-old blog post rather than the latest, squeakiest link.\"\nRao's dream is to one day see \"a bunch of people at an airport, on iPad-like devices, zooming in and out of the web using trails and really making full use of the power of their brains to process information at multiple levels and through multiple modes: visual, verbal, tactile,\" he said.\n\"And Iâd like to see them doing so with relaxed control and mastery instead of the anxiety and stress I see on peopleâs faces everywhere. Iâd like to see us literally getting on top of information instead of being buried by it. If Trailmeme can help do that, thereâs no telling where we could go.\"\nSample Trail: History of the Battery\n[[Augmenting the Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]]\nThinking about these in prep for [[Tiago Debate]]\n[[Maker Schedule]]\n[[many eyeballs]]\n((O6VeVunwd))\n--\n[[Intermediate Packets]]\n((WM-6IWRsA))\nreminded of idea from [[Andy Clark]] from [[The World Beyond Your Head]]\nâadvanced cognition depends crucially on our ability to dissipate reasoning: to diffuse achieved knowledge and practical wisdom through complex structures, and to reduce the loads on individual brains by locating those brains in complex webs of linguistic, social, political and institutional constraints.â \nAndy Clark, Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again (Cambridge, MA: Bradford Books, 1997), 180.\n{{[[TODO]]}} import [[Paul Graham]] essay [[Makers vs Managers Schedule]]\n{{[[TODO]]}} import whole [[vgr]] thread on Roam\n[[vgr]][[Tweet]][[@RoamResearch]]\nOk starting to kick the tires on \n@RoamResearch\n ... this is going to be my starting point.\nQuote Tweet\n\nadam keesling\n@adam_keesling\n Â· Nov 19\nIf you want to try yourself, here's the link:\n\nhttps://roamresearch.com\n\nDemos / articles:\n\nhttps://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1wnq-ZAAN\n\nOther resources that were helpful for the understanding what makes good notes:\n\nhttps://lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1\n\nhttps://lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017\n\nSo it's like workflowy but with transclusion links? I like the premise so far. I've used workflowy half-assedly for years and this zettlekasten thing sounds similar to how I do index cards though way too disciplined.\n\nNot sure I like bulleted lists as the first class citizen. My basic unit is the paragraph and I don't think in lists well. We'll see. There's a soft line break within a bullet point, but no way to just have an unbulleted prose chunk as a page it seems.\n\nWhat's with this Daily Note thing... is it a soft prompt to create a journal-like log as a throughline for non-chronological notes?\n\nSlightly unclear on how this is not a wiki.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nMy first expt is to try and bring notes from Scrivener for my book project over. I have a folder called \"nuggets\" that I'm porting manually. Copying smaller fragments to roam and moving larger chunks to a different Scrivener folder. Roam is clearly not for composing long texts.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nWtf is a cose layout?\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nThis thing needs Hebbian synapses. I'm creating a big pile of chaos here, in large part because most of the organization is latent, in rhymes and associations that don't have strong overlap in vocabulary. Still unlinked-mentions is a sort of ersatz Hebbian synapse mechanism\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nOk I have my first feature request... email-based page creation. And some way to capture tweets and tweet threads in 1 step as pages.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nMy dangerous working theory is that if I dump all my unintegrated fragmentary thoughts, discovery notes, and links for book project into Roam, when I work on the chapters of the book, I can search this set of notes or wander the graph to collect up what I need for JIT compilation\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nSo I can confirm one thing: the tool does encourage you to frictionlessly capture latent connections explicitly. I'm not seeing \"new\" connections as such, but finding it much easier to capture ones I've already seen cleanly.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nAnother thing it is forcing me to do is clean up my foundational definitions to avoid creating redundant pages that will create merge-work later. The merge feature is a powerful forcing function.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nI'm creating a real mess here, but hopefully it will lead to enlightenment soon.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nHmm... I've reached a point of complexity, where it's actually helpful to create what I called a Dramatis Memetae. Something between an index and a glossary, but with a bit of structure to it.\nQuote Tweet\n\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\n Â· Oct 30\nI wish a lot of nonfiction books would start with a glossary.

Someone latinize these.\nShow this thread\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nYikes, the current view of my graph looks suspciously like a yak. I might have to shave this thing.\n\nSo far this is a view of a single project. I wonder if I put more disconnected projects in if it will start looking like a zoo.\nAlright, spent nearly 6 productive hours digesting 70% of email notes and 30% scrivener notes from multitemporallty into Roam, and found it improved greatly in the process. Still a condition of Chaos > Order, but Order is now winning.\n\nTo do: \n\n* Rest of email and scrivener \n* ~100 twitter bookmarks\n* ~50 index cards\n* ~50 iPhone photos of book pages\n* ~12 scapple mind maps\n* ~ half a moleskine equivalent paper notes \n* ~1 moleskine equivalent iPad pencil notes\n\nMy second brain clearly has mad cow disease\n\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nThis feels right because processing into Roam feels like progress against entropy, not merely porting from one unsatisfactory tool to another. Moving the ball forward rather than sideways. Iâm gaining authoritah.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nTentatively, I think this deserves hype itâs getting. If they solve intake, it will be a genuine paradigm shift. Theyâve managed to actually do what we tried valiantly to do with trailmeme at xerox a decade ago.  I can spot all the things theyâve done right that we got wrong.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nStill wrapping my head around transclusion as a working concept rather than vaporware ideal. Itâs not been really necessary so far though Iâve done a few to get a feel for it. I suspect doing a second compression pass after this discovery/intake pass could be transclusion-heavy\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nThe fact that I put in 6h of work despite intake automation being basically non-existent and high-friction suggests that once even a few basics are in place there (email-to-db would be my most used, followed by something to grab tweets easily) this could really take off.\nVenkatesh Rao\n@vgr\nÂ·\nNov 26\nI guess I leapfrogged past Notion, and there were a couple of other tools I started using like http://paper.supply but in view of this, I donât think others hit the right mix.

[[DiSSS or D3S Method]]\nDS3: Deconstruction:  Break the skill into smallest learnable units\nHe had fantastic hacks for deconstruction -- like finding a world class performer who lacked the \"natural talent\" and thus you could expect would have had to find the true \"fundamentals\", particularly one who was no longer in the spotlight, and then interview them\nDS3: Selection:  Select the units that have the highest return\n1000 words make up like 80% of the writing in a language (focus on those, and the words that matter to the domain you care about)\nDS3: Sequence: Identify the right order to learn the thing\nIf you learn the 100 words that are most important for conversing and asking questions, you can get to a place where practice is both enjoyable, and something you can do all the time.\nI found a number of other algorithms for this -- my favorite being\nScholarship: How to do it effectively \nWhich taught me both how to download textbooks for free, and convinced me that finding the best textbook (as a starting point) was completely worth it, compared with trying to piece together information from blog posts and youtube videos (those are excellent supplements, but not the fastest way to build a scaffold)\nProbably the most influential for me though was Mortimer Adler's How to Read a Book\nHis algorithm is for how to extract knowledge from a text\nRead the table of contents\nRead the index\nRead the introduction and conclusion\nSkim the book, (focusing on places where they author is summarizing their thoughts or spelling out key definitions (like the introduction and conclusion)\nSpend 80% (my number) of your time, on the truly great books that will stretch you -- give you new ontologies -- that have ideas worth grabbling with and presented as clearly as is possible for the idea.  \nDefinitely don't worry about finishing all the books you've read\nLook for key questions, arguments, and terms\nPull the author into conversation with the other authors on the topics (try and figure out where they agree and disagree)\nTry and map out their [[Ontology]] and underlying world view\n[[Junto Research Clubs]]\nI got so hooked on this idea, that at one point I organized a bunch of \"peer to peer research groups\" where we would all follow this algorithm (sort of a hybrid of Adler's process and Ferriss)\nWe created a standard process for how to Deconstruct the things we were trying to learn -- a way of approximating what the best sources would be,  selecting the most significant units, and sequence learning those units so we could gain mastery faster\nGoal obviously not being to cut corners -- but to focus on what is most relevant and fundamental -- if you can learn more efficiently, you can learn more, and thus bring together ideas from different fields \nObviously this was the sort of thing best done as a group (if you're exploring a new domain, and expect that some units -- which you don't know in advance, are going to be MUCH higher leverage than others, you want each person to go off and explore on their own -- then the group to exploit the best opportunites that each individual finds, and then do the same for each new domain that opens up based on your new knowledge)\nWe more of a focus on stakes (you had to pay $40 if you skipped the meeting, or failed to complete your reading and breaking down your book)\nI've noticed that this framework in particular [[Pareto Principle]] -- [[Collaborative Explore-Exploit]] has really shaped my worldview and directed my work. Also though, just noticing the impact of this [[Thought Algorithm]] has sort of kept me cued up to find other ones (and has motivated me to look for better ways of working with them)\nRelated [[The World Makes Sense. That is why we can have nice things.]]\nOther examples I mention above \nDouble Diamond Design Process\nMight not use this one\nPoints of Leverage in a System\nByron Katie's The Work\n[[Byron Katie]] is particularly powerful -- I used it once, sort of thing that I used once to solve a major relationship conflict -- had a similar experience with [[NVC]], but then noticed that I (while I didn't follow it so exactly in the future), it subtly shifted a lot.  Like other algorithms, its the sort of thing that worked incredibly well, but took effort, and didn't follow exactly again after, but showed me this different frame that then adjusted things subtly in the future\nAll the techniques taught at [[CFAR]], and the whole research space\n[[Double Crux]], [[Internal Family Systems]]\nIt opened me up to ideas like the one from [[Plato]], that [[There is no such thing as willpower, we just implement whatever we believe to be the best strategy]]\nAnd as a result, when you're having motivation issues (or procrastination issues), it is due to some set of underlying beliefs\nSome part of you believes that staying up until 4am playing Sid Meir's Civilization is the best use of your time, or yelling at your partner is the best way of getting your needs met, or beating yourself up about failure is the only way to ensure future success/acceptance/love/safety -- and that this conflict in your mind is the root of you \"getting in your own way\".\nWhich is to say -- the belief in thought algorithms (in general) lead me to pay particular attention to ones that look promising, and these have (I believe) pretty fundamentally shaped who I am (and how I interact with the world).  But as I said -- this \"belief\" in [[Thought Algorithm]]s (particularly in conjunction with my belief around [[Collaborative Explore-Exploit]]) also has inspired my work.  It lead me to building a non-linear writing tool.  Why?\nNote -- I'm motivated to share this due to [[Simon Syneak]] Thought Algorithm of [[Start With Why]], and I feel fine sharing this arguably self-promoting idea due to [[Gary Vanderchuck]]'s idea of [[Jab Jab Hook]]\nFor one -- due to a problem I ran into when i was [[Do things that don't scale]] in by running those peer to peer research groups [[Junto Research Clubs]]\nSo -- what was the problem?\nWell, in the aforementioned research club -- we were following a particular process.  << [[JRC-Process]]\nIdentify possible sources\nFilter for best guess at best sources\nWe would search sub-reddits (particularly for things like, best way to learn arabic characters)\n[[The Best Textbook on Every Subject]]\nEach person takes a book\nDeconstruct the book, using [[Analytic Reading]]\nFind Questions, Terms, Statements\nMap the ideas together\nFind out what questions are related -- useful framework here [[Make Just One Change]]\nWhen searching for an answer in [[Theoretical Books]]\nAssess argument structure first\nTry to [[Steelman]] arguments and pass the author's [[Ideological Turing Test]]\nWhen trying to develop a skill from [[Practical Books]]\nDo something like [[DiSSS or D3S Method]]\nIf you're curious -- here's one of the worksheets I put together for facilitating of these \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1fC3u5Wya_r2vs7uFrAuFRhtzp_4fiUsTn1y7limmlqQ/edit\nNote -- this is from 2013\n[[Slide Deck]] of [[How to Read A Book]]     \nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L-wnqfvtgW2gFWH6X1nMLqe5xVo7m0y00mFWokVJXnw/edit#slide=id.g9f1720b0d_2_43\nI noticed that the algorithm I was trying to run was obvious to me (I wrote it)-- but even though I knew the plan, it was still really helpful to have a scaffold\nWhen I set [[Pomodoro]] timers, and had the process written out (somewhat in the form of a worksheet) -- it was much easier to manage my attention\nThis was doubly true when other people were trying to both [[Learn the Process]] and execute it at the same time.\nWe had sub-process for each stage (deciding how to frame the question, finding sources, analyzing sources, building a learning path, following the path)\nThere is a reason that [[Byron Katie]] provides an ACTUAL [[Worksheet]]\nI think this is supported by [[Andy Clark]]'s ideas of [[Extended Cognition]] and [[David Kirsch]]'s ideas of [[The Intelligent Use of Space]]\n- The thing I'm always looking for from [[The World Beyond Your Head]] is in [[The Intelligent Use of Space]]\nYou can focus all your attention on the task in front of you\nYou don't have to worry about remembering what you're doing next\nThus it is easier to maintain momentum -- especially on cognitively difficult tasks.  \nYou're able to project manage yourself\nBeyond just helping people have less cognitive overhead while doing an inherently difficult thing (exploring a new field) it was also much much easier for people to collaborate and learn from each other's research, and build on each other's work when we were all following a similar enough process\nSo, what I ended up doing was creating a sort of [[Workflowy]] [[Templates]]\n[[Example]] \nBook\n----\nAuthor ---\nKey Questions\n1. ----\nAnswers \nAuthor's Proposed Answer\n1. ---- \nExample\n1. ----\nQuotes\n1. ----\nReasons\n1. ---- \nInvalidated Answers\n1. -----\nReasons \n1.  -------\nYou might be able to guess at the obvious problems with using a structure like that\nWorkflowy was great for input -- but the structure of the information we were trying to collect was really poorly suited to a tree (particularly for the things we wanted to do, AFTER we collected out the key ideas)\nRemember, the next steps after [[DS3: Deconstruction]] are [[DS3: Selection]] and [[DS3: Sequencing]]\nThe same question or concept for example was being addressed in multiple places throughout the book -- (during reading, we often wanted to break things down by chapter), but then you also wanted to relate the questions to each other, and filter out most important questions in a book for sharing with other people on the team\nThere was this [[Many to Many]] relationship between questions claims and terms, and chapters -- even just within the same book -- and Workflowy didn't represent that.  \nYou could use links to point to different parts of the tree using links -- but those links only worked in one direction (similar to [[Quote-tweet]]s) -- so you'd have to put 2x as many links if you wanted to be able to go from high-level questions to detailed questions and move back.\nThe problem only got worse when you were trying to connect ideas across books and resources\nThis is possibly a strange problem to run into -- the only other person I've seen who has run into this exact problem was someone who supervised a team of researchers who were reading medical papers and trying to create custom [[Meta-analysis]]es for [[Rare Diseases]].\nTheir goal was to help clients make sense of a bunch of hard-to-parse research data and make suggestions on what interventions would actually be appropriate\nProbably not a coincidence -- this is also the person who was the first to get extremely exited about the tool we've been building.\n[[Sarah Constantin]]\nThey also found that lack of good tooling for this problem made their project far more difficult to execute on -- and despite having a really stellar team, and substantial funding -- that bottleneck looks like it may have broken some of the economics needed to make the project really viable. \nI also found that -- not having good tools for taking the following steps beyond Deconstruction really made me question the worthiness of continuing down the path using Workflowy.  \nThe quotes we were collecting, summaries we were writing, and links we were drawing was all clearly DATA -- but when there was very little we could do with the data -- (besides just read and think) -- it was much harder to justify the extra effort.\nI looked at what we were trying to do (and the pattern of [[Thought Algorithm]]s in general) and clearly there was some abstract problem to solve here -- so the obvious answer (to a tech bro) -- write some software! $$\\red{\\text{A}}$$\n[[Learning to Code Backstory]]\nProblem then -- I had been a mostly non-technical CEO, and was more than a bit traumatized over sale of my first company (CTO had lost faith in vision and in me, so had to sell to get a soft-landing (first world problem sure -- but had really felt like selling out and triggered huge amount of self-loathing/imposter syndrome))\nI also felt like I needed to walk-the-talk of this whole [[DiSSS or D3S Method]] of [[DS3: Deconstruction]] deconstructing knowledge -- and at the time I was running these research groups (later condensed to 8 hour \"Learnathon\" meetups) -- the hard thing everyone wanted to learn was web-development.\nSo, obvious answer was -- STFU and deconstruct web-development until I was a skilled enough engineer for really skilled people to actually want to work with.  -- Biggest fear was being pointy headed boss from Dilbert. (Also lit says people only like working for people who could actually do their job)\nAlso -- try and figure out character flaws that caused first CTO to lose faith in me in the first place.\nResult of that process brought me to [[Clojurescript]] and starting [[CLJRC]] \nI found, what I perceived and perceive to be the 20% that produced highest gains -- datalog, and then found experts in that community -- provided value to them by connecting them to each other -- and giving them a [[Thought Algorithm]] of [[Hamming Questions]] and the [[The Art of Science and Engineering]] \"If you know what you're doing in Science, you shouldn't be doing it\"\nSelection got me focused on the ideas of [[Bret Victor]] and [[Doug Engelbart]] -- and learning design\nSo -- what are the abstract problems? from $$\\red{\\text{A}}$$\nSee [[Thought Vectors]] tweet from [[Samim]]\n1. Template -- I want to be able to specify a structure (particularly of questions I'm going to ask)\nShould be able to specify up front a [[Thought Algorithm]] -- a plan that you are going to go through\nEach step in the algorithm requires thinking -- but there were some generic structures (similar to programming [[concepts]])\nFor example\n[[Brainsort]] for [[Sort a [[List]]]]\n[[Deslider]] for [[Reduce]]\nIn my case -- its the selection of material, the deconstruction of the material, filtering, and then sequencing\nYou should be able to focus on each step -- one a time (so you don't overwhelm working memory)-- but still have it fit into the overall structure, and be able to use the output of each steps in other steps\nThose higher level steps being things like -- combining and comparing ideas with each other [[Reduce]], filtering out certain things [[Filter]], and generating new lists from applying a new question to the result of a previous operation [[Map]].\n[[Mapping Question]] -- [[Map]]\nI knew for example -- I'd ask a question, the answer to that question would be a list -- for each item in the list I'd then ask a different question \n(I might want to filter the list, or sort the list, or generate a new list by applying another question (or relation) over the old list)\n-- and on and on --  basically, I wanted to \"map\" a question over a sequence of thoughts to generate a new sequence, then map another question over that sequence\nThe key thing though is -- I wanted to see where each new thought had come from -- and also be able to use each thought in multiple different algorithms. $$\\red{\\text{3}}$$\n2. I want the results from one process to feed into other ones\nIf I have a list of people I respect, and for each of them I've found out their favorite book on the topic -- I want to be able to take that list of books from all those people, filter by topic etc.\n$$\\red{\\text{3}}$$  I wanted to be able to show others (and myself) Algorithm, and the intermediate results -- sort of like a step-through debugger (and I wanted the whole chain to be reactive to updates at any part of the process)\nFor instance -- If I have filtered a list of say \"potential features for an app\" based on some criteria like \"technical feasibility\", and my evidence for removing a feature from the list was based on some mistaken belief, I wanted someone else (or my future self), to be able to update that belief, and then have the feature be added back to the list of potential features.\nSimilarly, if I felt that something was true, and my argument for believing it was based on a research paper that later failed to replicate -- or was invalidate by another paper or argument, I wanted my future self (or a trusted collaborator) to be able to update the claim and all beliefs based on that one get flagged.\n4. I wanted a tool that reflected both the Hierarchy of Ideas, and the underlying network\nQuotes are part of books -- but the ideas they express are connected with all the ideas in all the books (and even your hierarchical structure should be fluid -- so you could organize books by author and by topic, and by things like what beliefs they've updated you on)\nArguments have a logical structure -- even if they aren't [[Deductive]], they still have some [[Probabilistic]] influence on one another\nIdeas also have [[Terms]], which authors use in different ways, so I want to be able to do thinks like [[Replace the Term with the Definition]] \nIf I have to copy and paste ideas all over the place, I lose the structure of the thoughts, its harder to [[Compose]] ideas -- build them up from one another. \n5. I wanted a tool that deals with irregularly shaped data\nWorkflowy and [[Wiki]]s are great for this\nYou can always just add another bullet for meta commentary or to follow a thought in some other direction\n[[Table]]s are bad for this\nHard to annotate the value of a cell\nWhen comparing some dissimilar items -- end up having to have columns for the set of all attributes on all the items -- leads to really hard to read tables.\n6. I want a UI that helps me focus my attention on exactly the part of the problem I'm going through at that moment\n[[Concept Maps]] and [[Mind Maps]]\n[[Workflowy]]\n[[Worksheet]]s and [[Typeform]]\n[[Annotations]] in [[Document Mode]]\n[[Table]]s and [[Faceted Search]] for comparing collections\n[[Filter]]s\nFrom [[Conversation]] with [[Michael Merchant]]\nFirst thing you do in [[Brainstorm]]ing meeting is to brainstorm the [[Prompts]]\nExample of a question that generates more question\nSimilar to [[Make Just One Change]]\n[[Workflowy]], [[Excel]], [[Plectica]] -- [[Mind Maps]], [[Google Docs]] are all input devices for getting thoughts out of your head, and turning those thoughts into data [[Input Devices]]\nProblem is, there is nothing you can do with that data afterwords\nEach of those is good for different kinds of things -- each of those things they're good for is useful for a different part of the thinking process\nWhat is needed is a way of creating Streams of data transformation -- where the transformation is something you are doing with your mind (like answering a brainstorming prompt -- or comparing objects, or ranking options), and the whole pipeline is visible -- and reactive to changes you make at each step of the process.\nYou want to be able to \"play computer\" with yourself -- to step through the algorithm, to reuse the results of each step for other operations, and have changes flow upstream and downstream.\nDoug Engelbart called these [[Process Hierarchies]]\nWhat makes these processes useful?\nWhat shape do these functions takes?\nFirst they recognize that there is a TEMPLATE, for certain class of problems\nThe problems \nI'll start with one of my favorite examples of a thought algorithm -- Scholarship: How to Do it Effectively\nThey take one or more thoughts as input, and then run a transformation on those thoughts to bring you to the next step\nThis is one of my favorite examples\n[[DiSSS or D3S Method]]\n[[The Intelligent Use of Space]]\n03:59 -- 04:09\n06:12\n[[Long Term Thoughts]]\nswitching to private Roam for free association\nGivin [[visakanv]] some unwanted tips on bookmarks\n[[Bookmarks]]\n[[Culture]]\n[[Singapore]]\nx\ny\n[[Politics]]\n[[Singapore]]\nz\ny\nx\n15:38\nConversation with [[Lawrence]] about Roam as a [[Lisp environment]]\narbitrary html in Roam\n```:hiccup [:div\n         {:style \n          {:display \"flex\"\n           :background-color \"red\" \n           :width \"100px\" \n           :height \"200px\"}} \n         \txy \n         [:button XYZ]]```\n:hiccup [:div {:style {:background-color \"red\" :width \"100px\" :height \"200px\" :display \"flex\"}} xy [:button XYZ]]\nArbitrary [[Datalog]] queries over the Roam instance\n```:q [:find ?t ?e ?o  :where \n\t[?e :node/title \"What People Are Saying\"]\n\t[?e :block/children ?x]\n\t[?x :block/order ?o] \n\t[?x :block/string ?t] ]```\n:q [:find ?t ?e ?o  :where \n[?e :node/title \"What People Are Saying\"]\n[?e :block/children ?x]\n[?x :block/order ?o] \n[?x :block/string ?t] ]\n[[ESV]]\n[[Genesis]]\n[[Genesis 1]]\n[[Genesis 1:1]] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. \n[[Genesis 1:2]] The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.\n\n\n[[Genesis 1:3]] And God said, âLet there be light,â and there was light. \n[[Genesis 1:4]] And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.  \n[[Genesis 1:5]] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.\n\n\n[[Genesis 1:6]] And God said, âLet there be an expansea in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.â \n[[Genesis 1:7]] And God madeb the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. \n[[Genesis 1:8]]And God called the expanse Heaven.c And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.\n\n\n[[Genesis 1:9]]And God said, âLet the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.â And it was so. \n[[Genesis 1:10]] God called the dry land Earth,d and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.\n\n[[Genesis 1:11]] And God said, âLet the earth sprout vegetation, plantse yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.â And it was so. \n[[Genesis 1:12]] The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. \n[[Genesis 1:13]] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.\n\n[[Genesis 1:14]] And God said, âLet there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons,f and for days and years, \n[[Genesis 1:15]] and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.â And it was so. [[Gen:1:16]]And God made the two great lightsâthe greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the nightâand the stars. [[Gen:1:17]]And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, [[Gen:1:18]]to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.\n\n\n[[Gen/1/20]]And God said, âLet the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birdsg fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.â [[Gen/1/21]]So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. [[Gen/1/22]]And God blessed them, saying, âBe fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.â [[Gen/1/23]]And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.\n\n\n[[Gen/1/24]]And God said, âLet the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kindsâlivestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.â And it was so.

And Three in Person\".\nOne of the key verses in God's Word .... held as centrally sacred by the Jews ...... isÂ [Deuteronomy 6:4]().\nThe Jews call it \"The Shema\" (shuh-mah): (Slow) BIBLE \"Hear, O Israel: .... the [[Lord]] our God, .... the [[Lord]] is ...One!\" END ([Deuteronomy 6:4]())\nJudaism and Christianity ......are both thoroughly committed to the belief.... in One God, .... and One God alone.\nThe first commandment God gave to Moses was: \"You shall have no other gods before Me\" ([Exodus 20:3]()).\nThat does not mean.... \"before Me\" .... as in .... \"ahead of Me\".\nGod was not saying ......He was to be .... the most important God .... on their list.\n\"Before Me\" ... literally means.... \"Before My Presence\".\nYou are not to entertain other gods ......because .... there are ......no other gods. (Pause)\nYet, ... within that One God, ......within that One Supreme Being, .... there are three distinct Persons.\nAnd this is revealed ... from the opening chapter of Genesis. BIBLE \"Then God said: 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.'\" END [[Genesis 1:26]]\nNOTE: ... There is only ONE image, ... and there is only ONE likeness (Singular).\nBut the Plural is also used ... \"Let US -- plural -make man ...in OUR image -one image-, ... according to OUR likeness\" one likeness.\nWhat we have in Genesis ....is a revelation of the communion......the fellowship of the Godhead ... at Creation: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\"Let Us make man .... In our Image\".\nThe Father the first Person of the Trinity ......is God.\nAnd ... Jesus the Second Person of the Trinity ...is God.\nJesus is Not just a good man; ... Jesus is Not just a prophet.\n(Slow) Jesus is .... God. ...... The second Person of the Trinity.\nCo-equal and co-eternal with the Father.\nJohn's Gospel Begins with this acclimation of truth: BIBLE \"In the beginning ... was the Word, ...and the Word was with God, ....and the Word was God.\" END ([John 1:1]())\nUnbelievers can do all the translation gymnastics they want to, ...... but No Reputable Greek scholar .... would translate this verse ....to read any other way...... than John declaring .... Jesus to be ......God.\nAnd Jesus states this clearly when he said...... \"Before Abraham was ... I am.\" ([John 8:58]())\nAnd the Pharisees and the Sadducees clearly understood .... what Jesus was saying ......in the proclamation ...... \"I am\".\nFor God almighty said to Moses ......\" tell them...... I am .... sent you.\" ([Exodus 3:14]())\nJesus himself affirms .... that he is...... the I am.\n(Slow) That He is ... God.\n(1 Finger) So...The Father ... is God, (2 Fingers) Jesus is God (3 Fingers) and the Holy Spirit ... the third Person of the Trinity Beloved ... is God.\nThe Holy Spirit is Not .... a \"force\".\nThe Holy Spirit.... is Not ......an \"It\".\nThe Holy Spirit is a Person... the third Person of the Trinity.\nThe Holy Spirit is...... The all-knowing... all-seeing, every-present God.\n(Pick up the Bible) Remember the story of Ananias and Sapphira?\nBefore Ananias was struck dead, ... Peter told him:\nBIBLE \"Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? . . . You have not lied to men; ......but to God.\" END ([Acts 5:3-4]())\nThe Scriptures are Crystal clear ......lying to the Holy Spirit ... is lying to God.\nWe also ... see other Scriptural evidence ......that the Holy Spirit is God.\nWe are told that:\nThe words of God ......are words .... Inspired by the Holy Spirit.\nThe Scriptures tell us that ... One born of the Spirit .... is said to be .... born of God.\nThe Holy Spirit the third Person of the divine Trinity ......is God.\nGod ... the Father... God ... the Son ... and God ... the Holy Spirit.\nGod in three persons.... blessed Trinity. (Pause)\nBeloved ... There is a false belief .... called \"Modalism\" ... that I believe you need to understand...as a follower of the Christ.\nI mention this...... because some sincere Christians ......fall into this error .... without even realizing .... That Modalism ... is heresy.\nModalism basically states: ......there is One God .... that manifests Himself ....at different times .... in three different Modes.... or Persons.\nNow if you were not listening carefully ......that might sound .... OK.\nThe Modalist's state ......God has appeared at times ....in the mode of the Father.\nFor instance, ....it was the voice of the Father .... that spoke out of the burning bush to Moses.\nAt other times, they state ...... God appears ....as the Son.\nFor instance, .... when He came in the mode of the Son ....and lived on earth.... for thirty-three years.\nAnd then at other times...they state...... That God.... came in the mode of .... the Holy Spirit.\nYet ... Do you see what is wrong?\nWith Modalism ......you do not have three distinct Persons, .... (Slow) you have One Person ......being revealed ....in three different ways.\nAnd that is not the historical faith ......of the Church.\nThe Church believes.... that the three distinct Persons of the Godhead ... co-exist together .... ....at all times...... (Slow) Beloved ... at all times.\nModalism ....is easily shown ......to be wrong ....by just one scene .... from the Scriptures:\nAt the Baptism of Jesus.... all three persons of God .... are present ......at the very same time.\nThe Son ....is in the water... being baptized.\nThe Holy Spirit .... descends as a dove.\nThe Father's voice .... sounds from heaven.\nAll three Persons ...are present ...at very same time.\nGod in three Persons...Blessed Trinity.\nThough nothing in our world ... Nothing on this side of eternity ... can fully illustrate the Trinity, ... teachers and theologians through the ages ... have offered several analogies.\nAnalogies ... drawn from the realms of nature and mathematics ... in order to ... help explain ... the unexplainable.\nThere is the analogy of the Egg.\n(Fingers) The Shell -- The Yoke -- The White.\nThe shortfall of this ... and others like it, ... is that God cannot be divided into ... \"parts.\"\nAnother common illustration uses water as the example: ... water exists as a solid (ice), .... a liquid, .... and a gas (water vapor).\nNo matter what physical state water is in, ... it is still water.\nThough closer ... The problem with this illustration ... is that liquid water, when it freezes, \"switches\" ... from liquid to solid, ...and, when it boils, ... it \"switches\" to vapor.\nHowever, ... God does not \"switch\" states ... or modes.\nLiquid water can become solid or gas, ... but God the Father never becomes ... the Son or the Spirit.\nAs I thought about Trinity ...Tri-unity it brought to my mind ... a fresh baked pie ... right from the oven.\nDo you enjoy pie? ... I love a good cherry or apple pie.\nMy grandmother made a great apple pie.\nI love apple pie ...especially when it is hot ... with the filling oozing out ... when you removed a slice.\nImagine for a moment that the pie is sliced ... in the pan ... into three large pieces.\nI would surely enjoy eating a piece that Big.\nIn fact, ... I probably have eaten ... a piece that big.\nWell ...Imagine three large pieces of pie ... that are sliced ... yet left in the pie pan.\nThere are three pieces ... yet one pie.\nAnd the filling ... the internal substance ... is the same for all three.\nJust as the essence the eternal substance of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are the same.\nThough closer ... even this illustration falls short ... of the essence of Trinity.\nBeloved ... We see through a glass dimly ... yet We are called ...to look through the glass ... as dim as it might be at times.\nWe are created.... \"in the image of God\". [[Genesis 1:27]]\nAnd God .... has Never been .... without fellowship.\nBefore anything was created; .... before there was a single angel, .... or any other being, .... there was God.\nWas He alone? NO.... Never!\nWhen there was nothing but God, ......there was always .... fellowship.\nThere was always the eternal communion.... of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\nAnd We to .... are created ....in God's image.\n(Slow) We to.... desire fellowship....... fellowship with each other .... Yet most of all .... fellowship with the Triune God.\nJesus prayer to the Father was that his disciples be one as he was one with the Father.

How are you? \n\n\n\n00:16\n(Audience) Good. \n\n\n\n00:18\nIt's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. \n\n\n\n00:24\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n00:30\nThere have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. \n\n\n\n00:57\nI have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. \n\n\n\n01:12\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n01:16\nIf you work in education, you're not asked. \n\n\n\n01:19\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n01:22\nAnd you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God. Why me?\" \n\n\n\n01:35\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n01:38\n\"My one night out all week.\" \n\n\n\n01:39\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n01:42\nBut if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. \n\n\n\n02:24\nAnd the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. \n\n\n\n02:58\nSo I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. \n\n\n\n03:10\n(Applause) \n\n\n\n03:11\nThank you. \n\n\n\n03:13\n(Applause) \n\n\n\n03:17\nThat was it, by the way. Thank you very much. \n\n\n\n03:19\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n03:21\nSo, 15 minutes left. \n\n\n\n03:23\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n03:26\n\"Well, I was born ... \" \n\n\n\n03:28\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n03:32\nI heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will in a minute.\" #[[The Drawing of God Anecdote]]\n\n03:57\n(Laughter) \n\n04:08\nWhen my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. \n\n04:13\n(Laughter) \n\n04:15\nIf we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? \n\n04:21\n(Laughter) \n\n\n04:22\nNo, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it. \n\n04:26\n(Laughter) \n\n04:28\n\"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" \n\n\n05:09\n(Laughter) \n05:22\nWhat these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. \n06:06\nPicasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? \n\n06:24\nI lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was. \n\n06:32\n(Laughter) \n\n06:34\nActually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? \n\n06:55\n(Laughter) \n\n07:02\nHow annoying would that be? \n07:04\n(Laughter) \n07:11\n\"Must try harder.\" \n07:13\n(Laughter) \n07:17\nBeing sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare. \"And put the pencil down!\" \n\n07:23\n(Laughter) \n\n07:24\n\"And stop speaking like that.\" \n\n07:25\n(Laughter) \n\n07:29\n\"It's confusing everybody.\" \n\n07:30\n(Laughter) \n\n07:35\nAnyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. \n\n07:58\n(Laughter) \n\n07:59\nMind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- \n\n08:11\n(Laughter) \n\n08:19\nbecause she was the main reason we were leaving the country. \n\n08:22\n(Laughter) \n\n08:28\nBut something strikes you when you move to [[America]] and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? \n\n09:11\n(Laughter) \n\n09:14\nTruthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. \n\n09:24\nIf you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. \n\n09:49\n(Laughter) \n\n09:53\nAnd I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. \n\n10:22\n(Laughter) \n\n10:28\nDon't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings. \n\n10:31\n(Laughter) \n\n10:37\nIf you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night. \n\n\n10:46\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n10:49\nAnd there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. \n\n\n\n10:55\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n10:57\nWaiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it. \n\n\n\n11:01\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n11:03\nOur education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. \n\n\n11:19\nNumber one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? \"Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. \n\n\n11:42\nAnd the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. \n\n\n12:07\nIn the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. \n\n\n12:24\nSuddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. \n\n\n12:37\n(Laughter) \n\n\n12:38\nBut now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. \n\n\n12:57\nWe know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. \n\n\n13:34\nBy the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully. \n\n\n13:57\n(Laughter) \n\n\n14:00\nNo, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- \n\n\n14:07\n(Laughter) \n\n\n\n14:08\nshe's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" \n\n\n14:19\n(Laughter) \n\n\n14:26\n\"Give me a break.\" \n\n\n14:27\n(Laughter) \n\n\n14:29\nActually, do you know that old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" \n\n\n14:44\n(Laughter) \n\n\n14:52\nAnd the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. \n\n\n15:21\n(Laughter) \n\n\n15:23\nGillian and I had lunch one day. I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. \n\n\n15:46\n(Laughter) \n\n\n15:50\nPeople weren't aware they could have that. \n\n\n15:52\n(Laughter) \n\n\n15:54\nAnyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, \"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,\" and they went and left her. \n\n\n\n16:28\nBut as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\" \n\n\n\n16:51\nI said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. \n\n\n\n17:32\n(Applause) \n\n\n\n17:40\nWhat I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. \n\n\n\n18:14\nThere was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right. \n\n\n\n18:34\nWhat TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will.

A lot of the change I've seen is [[fragmentation]]. US politics is much more polarized than it used to be. Culturally we have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful of happy cities, abandoning the rest. And increasing economic inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too. I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances of the same phenomenon. And moreover, that the cause is not some force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces that had been pushing us together.\nWorse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces that were ^^pushing us **together** were an anomaly^^, a one-time combination of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated â and indeed, that we would not want to repeat. #[[Master's Thesis]]\nThe two forces were war (above all [[World War II]]), and the rise of large corporations.\nThe effects of [[World War II]] were both economic and social. Economically, it decreased variation in [[income]]. Like all modern armed forces, [[America]]'s were socialist economically. ((4BLyK6lpA)), to each according to his need. More or less. Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they got was fixed according to their rank. And the flattening effect wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was conscripted too. Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the [[National War Labor Board]]. Like the military, they defaulted to flatness. And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.Â [[1](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f1n)]\nFrom each according to his ability {{comment-button}}\nBusiness owners weren't supposed to be making money either. FDR said \"not a single war [[millionaire]]\" would be permitted. To ensure that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was taxed at 85%. And when what was left after corporate taxes reached individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.Â [[2](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f2n)] {{comment-button}}\nSocially too the war tended to decrease variation. Over 16 million men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought together in a way of life that was literally uniform. Service rates for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.\nThough strictly speaking [[World War II]] lasted less than 4 years for the US, its effects lasted longer. Wars make central governments more powerful, and [[World War II]] was an extreme case of this. In the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired. Indeed, in some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched to the Soviet Union. In tax rates, federal power, defense spending, conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more like wartime than prewar peacetime.Â [[3](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f3n)]Â And the social effects lasted too. The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team in West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward. Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot like the army.\nIf total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company. And this too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.Â [[4](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f4n)]\nThe 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation. General Electric, General Foods, General Motors. Developments in finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled a new type of company whose goal was above all scale. Version 1 of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies dominating each big market.Â [[5](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f5n)]\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation, led especially by J. P. Morgan. Thousands of companies run by their founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day. It seemed to people at the time that this was the final state of things. John D. Rockefeller said in 1880The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone, never to return.He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next hundred years.\nThe consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for most of the 20th. By the end of [[World War II]], as Michael Lind writes, \"the major sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.\"\nFor consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but only a few of them. When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market there wasn't much to differentiate them.\nOne of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV. Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for eggheads and communists. The programs that the 3 networks offered were indistinguishable. In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they had to be suitable for everyone.\nAnd not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the same time. It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door neighbors. What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen every night. We were literally in sync.Â [[6](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f6n)]\nIn a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the world was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had something of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have in making people behave better. But, like children's books, TV was also misleading. Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to families while they're having dinner.\nI know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives. When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any outside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap, and I stopped watching it.Â [[7](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f7n)]Â But it wasn't just TV. It seemed like everything around me was crap. The politicians all saying the same things, the consumer brands making almost identical products with different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they were meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake \"colonial\" skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end that started to fall apart after a couple years, the \"red delicious\" apples that were red but onlyÂ nominally apples. And in retrospect, itÂ __was__Â crap.Â [[8](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f8n)]\nBut when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found practically nothing. There was no Internet then. The only place to look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall.Â [[9](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f9n)]Â There I found a copy ofÂ __The Atlantic__. I wish I could say it became a gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and incomprehensible. Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and pretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as if it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere. But though it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that wasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.\nIt wasn't just as consumers that the [[big companies]] made us similar. They did as employers too. Within companies there were powerful forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act. IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little more extreme than other [[big companies]]. And the models of how to look and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone within this world was expected to seem more or less the same. And not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired to it â which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people who weren't already in it. For most of the 20th century, working-class people tried hard to look middle class. You can see it in old photos. Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.\nBut the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us culturally. It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.\nAlong with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor unions. And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals with the unions where they paid over market price for labor. Partly because the unions were monopolies.Â [[10](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f10n)]Â Partly because, as components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their competitors would have to as well. And partly because in mid-century most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways to milk economies of scale. Just as startups rightly pay AWS a premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to pay a premium for labor.Â [[11](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f11n)]\nAs well as pushing [[income]]s up from the bottom, by overpaying unions, the [[big companies]] of the 20th century also pushed [[income]]s down at the top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K. Galbraith wrote in 1967 that \"There are few corporations in which it would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum.\"Â [[12](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f12n)]\nTo some extent this was an illusion. Much of the de facto pay of executives never showed up on their [[income]] tax returns, because it took the form of perks. The higher the rate of [[income]] tax, the more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it. (In the UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would even pay their kids' private school tuitions.) One of the most valuable things the [[big companies]] of the mid 20th century gave their employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax returns or [[income]] statistics. So the nature of employment in these organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic inequality. But even accounting for that, the [[big companies]] paid their best people less than market price. There was no market; the expectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades if not your whole career.Â [[13](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f13n)]\nYour work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market price. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek it. If the company promised to employ you till you retired and give you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the company so it could take care of you. Especially when you'd been working with the same group of people for decades. If you tried to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the organization that was going to take care ofÂ __them__. Plus if you didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if you couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way up.Â [[14](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f14n)]\nTo someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces, this situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now. From their point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking officers. They got paid a lot more than privates. They got to have expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around on the company's Gulfstreams. It probably didn't occur to most of them to ask if they were being paid market price.\nThe ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by starting your own company. That seems obvious to any ambitious person now. But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept. Not because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but because it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s, when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at prestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious institution and work one's way up the hierarchy. Your prestige was the prestige of the institution you belonged to. People did start their own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did, because in those days there was practically zero concept of starting what we now call aÂ [startup](http://paulgraham.com/growth.html): a business that starts small and grows big. That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century. Starting one's own business meant starting a business that would start small and stay small. Which in those days of [[big companies]] often meant scurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants. It was more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the elephant. {{comment-button}}\nBy the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious companies had come from in the first place. It seemed like they'd always been there, like the chemical elements. And indeed, there was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and the origins of the big companies. Many of the [[big companies]] were roll-ups that didn't have clear founders. And when they did, the founders didn't seem like us. Nearly all of them had been uneducated, in the sense of not having been to college. They were what Shakespeare called rude mechanicals. College trained one to be a member of the professional classes. Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort of grubby menial work that [[Andrew Carnegie]] or [[Henry Ford]] started out doing.Â [[15](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f15n)]\nAnd in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates. They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25% in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect, in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million [[World War II]] veterans to college. Few thought of it in these terms, but the result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford, but not to be [[Henry Ford]].Â [[16](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f16n)]\nI remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting to break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so dominant as it had been. We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks and the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been even more conformist than us. The mid-century model was already starting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time. We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in 1975 than 1965. And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.\nBut change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once. Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because it was more efficient to. Incumbents faced new competitors as (a) markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability. Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly narrow channels to consumers broadened. Markets themselves started to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And last but not least, the federal government, which had previously smiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things, began to realize it wasn't the last word after all.\nWhat J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, [[Henry Ford]] was to the vertical. He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron ore at one end and sent cars out the other. 100,000 people worked there. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car companies operate today. Now much of the design and manufacturing happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies ultimately assemble and sell. The reason car companies operate this way is that it works better. Each company in the supply chain focuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well or they can be swapped out for another supplier.\nWhy didn't [[Henry Ford]] realize that networks of cooperating companies work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their efforts, and you can do that much better with computers. Computers reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre of corporations. That is a fundamental change.\nIn the early 20th century, [[big companies]] were synonymous with efficiency. In the late 20th century they were synonymous with inefficiency. To some extent this was because the companies themselves had become sclerotic. But it was also because our standards were higher.\nIt wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred. The industries themselves changed. It became possible to make lots of new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the ones who did it best.\nMicrocomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by upstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was worth paying attention to. At the time IBM completely dominated the computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now that this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it. Most people at the time would have agreed with them. But what happened next illustrated how much more complicated the world had become. IBM did launch a microcomputer. Though quite successful, it did not crush Apple. But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up being supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side â from software, which didn't even seem to be the same business. IBM's big mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS. It must have seemed a safe move at the time. No other computer manufacturer had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if other manufacturers could offer DOS too? The result of that miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones. Microsoft now owned the PC standard, and the customer. And the microcomputer business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.\nBasically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet. That sort of thing did not happen to [[big companies]] in mid-century. But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.\nChange happened mostly by itself in the computer business. In other industries, legal obstacles had to be removed first. Many of the mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors. This didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as it sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient competition in politics. It ought to work for business too.\nGradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration it started to remove them. The word used for this process was misleadingly narrow: deregulation. What was really happening was de-oligopolization. It happened to one industry after another. Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after deregulation.\nDeregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s. In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their competitors. Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative standards. Any public company that didn't generate sufficient returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with one that would. Often the new managers did this by breaking companies up into components that were more valuable separately.Â [[17](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f17n)]\nVersion 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders. Version 2 was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations, but more was left to market forces. Which further accelerated the [[fragmentation]].\nIt's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a gradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem. There was a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was qualitatively different. The companies in the S&P 500 in 1958 had been there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.Â [[18](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f18n)]\nThe breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the spread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition? It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing power was a precondition for the rise of startups. I suspect it was for most of what happened in finance too. But was it a precondition for globalization or the LBO wave? I don't know, but I wouldn't discount the possibility. It may be that the re[[fragmentation]] was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was driven by steam engines. Whether or not computers were a precondition, they have certainly accelerated it.\nThe new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked out from under you? Ambitious people started to think of a career less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement) between companies introduced more competition in salaries. Plus as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much an employee contributed to the company's revenue. Both changes drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to diverge.\nBy no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term \"yuppie\" was coined. That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots of money. To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem worth naming. Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money? But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part of what it meant to be a professional. Young professionals were paying their dues, working their way up the ladder. The rewards would come later. What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted market price for the work they were doing now.\nThe first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the future. Nor did they work for [[big companies]]. They were professionals working in fields like law, finance, and consulting. But their example rapidly inspired their peers. Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they wanted one too.\nUnderpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else has to, or they can't get good people. And once started this process spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of people's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but industries.\nBut not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to get paid a lot. It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked in fields where it was easy to measure that.\nMore generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned precisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make your fortune. As in the past there were multiple ways to do it. Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune, the ambitious had to decide whether or not to. A physicist who chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.\nThe idea even flowed back into [[big companies]]. CEOs of [[big companies]] make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is prestige. In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige. They were the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making millions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea, so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they had been getting.Â [[19](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f19n)]\nMeanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end of the economic scale. As [[big companies]]' oligopolies became less secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus less willing to overpay for labor. And as the Duplo world of a few big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes â some of them overseas â it became harder for unions to enforce their monopolies. As a result workers' wages also tended toward market price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended to be lower. Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased the need for some kind of work.\nAnd just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation. People started to dress and act differently. Those who would later be called the \"creative class\" became more mobile. People who didn't care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu, and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs. Kids who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress \"preppy,\" and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious effort to look disreputable. In a hundred ways people spread apart.Â [[20](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f20n)]\nAlmost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing. Has it been net good or bad? I don't know; the question may be unanswerable. Not entirely bad though. We take for granted the forms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we don't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-centuryÂ [conformism](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3), I can tell you it was no utopia.Â [[21](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f21n)]\nMy goal here is not to say whether [[fragmentation]] has been good or bad, just to explain why it's happening. With the centripetal forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what will happen next? And more specifically, is it possible to reverse some of the [[fragmentation]] we've seen?\nIf it is, it will have to happen piecemeal. You can't reproduce mid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced. It would be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity. And once you understand the degree to which the economic history of the 20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce that either.\n20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a sense naturally. The war was due mostly to external forces, and the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase. If you want cohesion now, you'd have to induce it deliberately. And it's not obvious how. I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms of fragmentation. But that may be enough.\nThe form of fragmentation people worry most about lately isÂ [economic inequality](http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html), and if you want to eliminate that you're up against a truly formidable headwind â one that has been in operation since the stone age: technology.\nTechnology is a lever. It magnifies work. And the lever not only grows increasingly long, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.\nWhich in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people can create has not only been increasing, but accelerating. The unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked this underlying trend. The ambitious had little choice but to join large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other people â literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't have figured out how. But that constraint has gone now. Ever since it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces at work again.Â [[22](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f22n)]\nNot everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly. But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their peers get dragged along too.Â [[23](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f23n)]Â And as long as it's possible to get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for economic inequality to increase. Even if you eliminate all the other ways to get rich. You can mitigate this with subsidies at the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough to discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in productivity.Â [[24](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f24n)]\nThat form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay. Or rather, back to stay. Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely because it's not due to any particular cause. It's simply a reversion to the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was right for a hundred years. It's back now, and that's likely to be true for longer.\nI worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble. If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks. And then we'll waste our time trying to eliminate [[fragmentation]], when we'd be better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.\n**Notes**\n[[1]()] Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials prevailing at the end of [[World War II]] had become so embedded that they \"were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures of [[World War II]] had disappeared. Basically, the same differentials exist to this day, thirty years later.\" But Goldin and Margo think market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime compression of wages â specifically increased demand for unskilled workers, and oversupply of educated ones.\n(Oddly enough, the [[America]]n custom of having employers pay for health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)\n[[2]()] As always, tax rates don't tell the whole story. There were lots of exemptions, especially for individuals. And in [[World War II]] the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired immunity to tax avoidance. If the rich paid high taxes during the war it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.\nAfter the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite dramatic changes in tax rates. The lowest point occurred when marginal [[income]] tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950. Looking at the data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had little effect on what people actually paid.\n[[3]()] Though in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time of unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression. Which is not entirely a coincidence, because [[the Depression]] was one of the causes of the war. In many ways the New Deal was a sort of dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during wartime. The wartime versions were much more drastic and more pervasive though. As Anthony Badger wrote, \"for many [[America]]ns the decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but with [[World War II]].\"\n[[4]()] I don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to say, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of big corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would have a single cause.\n[[5]()] More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in Galbraith's words, of \"the world of the technically dynamic, massively capitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on the other.\" Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the former, and there was near zero crossover.\n[[6]()] I wonder how much of the decline in families eating together was due to the decline in families watching TV together afterward.\n[[7]()] I know when this happened because it was the season Dallas premiered. Everyone else was talking about what was happening on Dallas, and I had no idea what they meant.\n[[8]()] I didn't realize it till I started doing research for this essay, but the meretriciousness of the products I grew up with is a well-known byproduct of oligopoly. When companies can't compete on price, they compete on tailfins.\n[[9]()] Monroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969 the largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movieÂ __Dawn of the Dead__Â was shot there. Apparently the mall was not just the location of the movie, but its inspiration; the crowds of shoppers drifting through this huge mall reminded George Romero of zombies. My first job was scooping ice cream in the Baskin-Robbins.\n[[10]()] Labor unions were exempted from antitrust laws by the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914 on the grounds that a person's work is not \"a commodity or article of commerce.\" I wonder if that means service companies are also exempt.\n[[11]()] The relationships between unions and unionized companies can even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to protect their hosts. According to Michael Lind, when politicians tried to attack the A&P supermarket chain because it was putting local grocery stores out of business, \"A&P successfully defended itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby gaining organized labor as a constituency.\" I've seen this phenomenon myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.\n[[12]()] Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders) instead of themselves. He devoted much ofÂ __The New Industrial State__Â to trying to figure this out.\nHis theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive, and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists, motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good work and thereby earn the respect of their peers. There is something in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined with self-interest explains much of observed behavior.\n[[13]()] Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid executives at 300 big corporations found that three quarters of them had been with their company for more than 20 years.\n[[14]()] It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century executive salaries were low partly because companies then were more dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got too much. This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big company CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.\nCompanies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings till the 1920s. Till then they had to pay out their earnings in dividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion. Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall act in 1933.\nBy mid-century [[big companies]] funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings. But the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial controls of [[World War II]], must have had a big effect on social conventions about executive salaries. So it may be that the lack of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries as the cause.\nIncidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash. The banks now had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.\n[[15]()] Even now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find hardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how important it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the life of a company. DoingÂ [things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)Â is to how [[Henry Ford]] got started as a high-fiber diet is to the traditional peasant's diet: they had no choice but to do the right thing, while we have to make a conscious effort.\n[[16]()] Founders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid. \"Our founder\" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a walrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The thing to be when I was a kid was anÂ __executive__. If you weren't around then it's hard to grasp the cachet that term had. The fancy version of everything was called the \"executive\" model.\n[[17]()] The wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a combination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state anti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision in Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively sympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions Act of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy corporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made it possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation of the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates in the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined that never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many public companies trading below the value of their assets; and not least, the increasing complacency of managements.\n[[19]()] CEOs of [[big companies]] may be overpaid. I don't know enough about [[big companies]] to say. But it is certainly not impossible for a CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as the average employee. Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when he came back as CEO. It would have been a good deal for the board to give him 95% of the company. Apple's market cap the day Steve came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January 2016) would be worth about 30 billion. And it would not be if Steve hadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.\nMerely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the question of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid. And that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the broader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care about. {{comment-button}}\n[[20]()] The late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was more rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked sufficiently) than fragmentation. You're not seeing fragmentation unless you see people breaking off to both left and right.\n[[21]()] Globally the trend has been in the other direction. While the US is becoming more fragmented, the world as a whole is becoming less fragmented, and mostly in good ways.\n[[22]()] There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid 20th century. The main one was drilling for oil, which was open to newcomers because it was not something [[big companies]] could dominate through economies of scale. How did individuals accumulate large fortunes in an era of such high taxes? Giant tax loopholes defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson.\nBut becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could aspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street were in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and (b) success depended so much on luck.\n[[23]()] The Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in Silicon Valley. Google will pay people millions of dollars a year to keep them from leaving to start or join startups.\n[[24]()] I'm not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause of economic inequality in the US. But it's a significant cause, and it will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if you ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will use this route instead.\n**Thanks**Â to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Ron Conway, Chris Dixon, Benedict Evans, Richard Florida, Ben Horowitz, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Tim O'Reilly, Geoff Ralston, Max Roser, Alexia Tsotsis, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.

It serves as a dashboard of your current workload, helping you grasp the current progress of your projects with just a glance.\nMost people couldnât give you a full inventory of their projects if their life depended on it. Yet they also tell you that they have too much on their plate. Creating an accurate Project List gives you the confidence to say yes OR no to new commitments. Once you know how much capacity you actually have, the decision of what to fill it with can be intentional and strategic, instead of reactive.\nThere is often a resistance to writing down all our projects, because we fear that seeing them all in one place will be overwhelming. ^^But non-judgmentally collecting the full inventory is the first step to gaining control.^^ You committed to these projects â weâre just creating a tool to support you in managing them. #\nFollow the instructions below to create your Project List.Â **[Click here for an Evernote template to help you follow along](https://www.evernote.com/l/AMyTYOEbZS9KZZjaSZo_aHGXDaw-26_NMyA)**.\nThe definition of a âprojectâ\nThe key distinction to understand as you begin this process is that we arenât using the word âprojectâ in the usual vague sense. That word is used to refer to everything from a bathroom remodel to a multi-billion dollar construction project.\nWe are using the following definition of a project: âAny outcome youâre committed to that requires more than one work session to complete.â\nThis definition forces us to acknowledge the reality that even the simplest outcomesâââlike âbuy headphonesâ or âprepare an agendaââââusually require numerous steps. Instead of tracking all these steps in our heads, we want to track them in an external tool. Your Project List remembers all these steps for you, so you can focus only on the next action.\nMost people find that sticking to this definition produces a list of around 20â40 projects. This is why we want to use an external toolââânot our brains!\nStep 1: Do a brain dump of everything you think could be a project\nHereâs some things to consider and places to look:\n**Your mind**\nWhatâs worrying you that you havenât taken the time to identify as a project? Whatâs taking more mental bandwidth than it deserves? What needs to happen that youâre not making consistent progress on, that could benefit from a project structure?\n__Example: âMy back is hurtingâ => Schedule doctorâs appointment__\n**Calendar**\nLook a few weeks into the past: what do you need to follow up on? What needs wrapping up? What projects do you want to create out of events that already happened?\nLook a few weeks into the future: what needs planning and preparation? What requires some goal-setting? Who do you need to catch up with?\n__Example: âI need to figure out what weâll do at that team off-siteâ => Plan team off-site agenda__\n**To Do list**\nWhat actions are you already taking, that are actually part of a bigger project youâve not yet identified?\n__Example: âI need to follow up with that house cleanerâ => Find cleaner and schedule weekly cleaning time__\n**Agendas**\nWhat communication or followup actions youâve scheduled with people are actually part of a bigger project?\n__Example: âI need to call Linda backâ => Develop sales campaign with Linda__\n**Briefcase/bag/wallet/purse**\nWhat objects or papers have you saved because they remind you to take an action? What have you not gotten rid of because itâs needed for a project?\n__Example: Business card in purse => Follow up with potential contractor from conference__\n**Physical environment**\nLook around your office, home, car, or desk: what physical objects represent projects you havenât identified as projects?\nDocument on desk => Package up and mail document to business partner\n**Computer**\nLook at your computer desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, bookmarks, emails, open browser tabs: what are you keeping around because it is part of a project?\n__Example: PDF article => Read draft article and give feedback to co-author__\n**Processes or procedures**\nWhich processes in your work or life could be more efficient, streamlined, or purposeful? What do you do regularly that takes too long, is too difficult, or hasnât been thought through?\n__Example: Grocery shopping => Collect list of staple food supplies and set up recurring deliveries__\n**Creative opportunities**\nWhat would you like to learn, develop, build, put on, pursue, start, explore, or play with as a project?\n__Example: Flyer for improv class => Look up and schedule improve class__\n**Competence building**\nWhich skills would you like to learn? Which hobbies would you like to start? What kind of project could advance your career, or make your life more fun or interesting?\n__Example: Email confirmation for online course purchase => Complete online course on coding__\nDonât worry about the exact definition of a project at this stage. In the next step, weâll decide what to do with this initial brainstorm.\nStep 2: Organize and refine your list\nSome options to consider:\n**Delete anything that is obviously not a project**\nSometimes you just need to write something down to realize itâs not something youâre committed to.\n**Combine projects that are tied to the same outcome**\nâWipe old computerâ and âResearch new computersâ could be part of the same project âBuy new computer.â\n**If a project can be substituted by a calendar entry, add it to your calendar instead**\nFor example, âPick up sister from airportâ doesnât really need to be actively tracked over time. Seeing it on the appropriate day will trigger all the necessary actions.\n**Move âsomeday/maybeâ projects to the bottom of the list**Keep track of these future projects, but donât let them clutter your current list.\nStep 3: Define the desired outcome of each project\nLook at each project on your list and ask yourself: what is my desired outcome for this project? What would need to happen for this project to be considered an outstanding success?\nI suggest writing these desired outcomes in the present tense, to help project yourself forward in time to when the outcome you are describing has come true:\nProject: Schedule doctorâs appointment =>Â **Outcome**: Back pain is resolved and I can sleep through the night without discomfort\nProject: Plan team off-site agenda =>Â **Outcome**: Team is clear about what needs to be accomplished and next actions are identified and assigned\nProject: Develop sales campaign with Linda =>Â **Outcome**: Sales campaign is approved by exec team, budget is allocated, and team is briefed on it\n**Add a date**\nPart of defining the desired outcome is deciding âby when.â Every single project on your list needs to have a specific deadline or timeframe that leaves no room for confusion (such as âby June 30, 2017,â âby the end of 2017,â or âby the end of Q3 2017.â).\nThis is the true test of whether it is actually a project. Even if the deadline seems arbitrary, it serves as a reminder for you to check on your progress and reevaluate your approach.\nAdd a target completion date for each project on your list.\n**Use action verbs**\nWeâre looking for a verb that describes DONE: finalize, submit, deliver, complete, send, clarify, organize, update, implement, resolve, submit, reorganize, design, roll out, install, set up, publish, or complete.\nIf you find yourself using verbs such as manage, oversee, ensure, or maximize, it is probably an ongoing Area of Responsibility, not a Project. Something must be able to happen in the near term so that you can mark the project as âdone.â\nIf you see any projects that donât include clear action verbs, add them now.\nStep 4: Prioritize your list by project\nMost people prioritize their work at the level ofÂ __individual__Â tasks.\nHereâs the problem with this approach: it takes only one phone call, one email, or one new piece of information to completely change your priorities. Priorities are constantly shifting throughout your day and week. Why spend a lot of time to sit down and identify your priorities when theyâll probably change within minutes?\nBut itâs a very different story when it comes to prioritizingÂ __projects__.\nProjects move much more slowly, and donât change their priority even if thereâs an emergency. Itâs worth spending the time to clearly identify which projects are the top priority, because that is unlikely to change much during the course of a week.\nRearrange your Project List from most to least important for theÂ __current week__. Reprioritizing this list is as simple as moving projects up or down on the list. By doing this at the beginning of each week, you can focus your attention the rest of the week on those top priority projects, and not get distracted by the rest.\nMake an intuitive judgment of how much of your mental bandwidth each project should be taking up this week, and sort your list accordingly.\nStep 5: Evaluate your Project List\n**Does this include all the outcomes youâre committed to?**\nLook over the whole list from a birdâs eye view: does it accurately represent your current priorities, interests, values, and long-term goals? In which area do you have too many projects? Not enough? Which outcomes or goals you say are important to you donât have any projects targeted at them? Where are you spending time or attention that has no clear outcome or goal?\nFor any that are simply unclear, take a step back and ask âWhat am I really trying to accomplish here?â or âWhat bigger goal is this connected to?â\nWith this whole inventory in front of you, which projects should you cancel, postpone, renegotiate, or clarify?\nIn conclusion\nWith a clear and complete Project List in hand, you are now ready to execute on your tasks without having to remember which balls you have in the air. You can focus most of your attention on the top priority projects, while keeping an eye on the rest.\nConsider this exercise just the âfirst passâ on creating a Project List. Any time you feel you are lacking clarity and donât know where to focus, you can run through this checklist to gather up and prioritize all your commitments.\nEven better, you can make this exercise into a âWeekly Reviewâ â a standing appointment with yourself to reflect on the week and update your Project List. If you do this review from a more calm and balanced perspective, away from the chaos of the workweek, youâll find it easier to maintain balance throughout the week.\n03:24\nGreat writeup on [[Reddit]] on [[Building a Second Brain]] in [[Roam]]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/\nWriteup was missing [[Datepicker]] [[Features]] though, so created [[Roam Demo Videos]] gif and uploaded\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2F-XdQbsv1u8?alt=media&token=3a9c24b7-ba16-4f0d-90db-79faddf53c32)\nusing datepicker [[January 1st, 2020]]\nThis is a great way to schedule due dates, or the next day you want to look at something\nsince it will appear in the mentions of the next day\n[[January 3rd, 2020]]\n[[The Refragmentation]]\n[[Design Challenges]]\nRoam is currently hiring one or more additional full time interaction/visual designers. \nIf you are interested in joining our team, below are a few examples of some of our open questions.  \nSome are highly speculative, some are smaller tasks on our immediate roadmap.\nIf you think you have a good answer to any of these questions -- send us a public Roam page, or public Roam instance with screenshots of your mockups, wireframes or interaction gifs or videos and your commentary on the problem \nIf we agree that you've solved the problem and decided we want to implement it, we'll happily pay you a bounty for the work you've already done (between $100 and $2000) and have a phone screen and/or fly you out to San Francisco to interview with the team.\nProblems\n[[Programmable Attention]]\nMany apps use sophisticated algorithms and psychological tricks to hijack user's attention to do things like maximize the amount of time they spend looking at apps.

The same material can be learned many times faster if well formulated! The difference in speed can be stunning!\nThe rules are listed in the order of importance. Those listed first are most often violated or bring most benefit if complied with!\nThere is an underlying assumption that you will proceed with learning using spaced repetition, i.e. you will not just learn once but you will repeat the material optimally (as inÂ [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/smintro)).\n**The 20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning**\n[**Do not learn if you do not understand**]()\nTrying to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost nonsense. Still, an amazing proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable.\nIf you are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German. The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such \"blind learning\" is astronomical. Even more important: The value of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you will still know nothing of history.\nThe German history book example is an extreme. However, the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you believe \"it will be useful some day\".\n[**Learn before you memorize**]()\nBefore you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules, you need toÂ **build an overall picture of the learned knowledge**. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure, will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is closely related to the problem comprehension mentioned inÂ [Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand](https://www.supermemo.com/#Do%20not%20learn%20if%20you%20do%20not%20understand). A single separated piece of your picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history.\nDo not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g.Â __the principles of the internal combustion engine__). Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers (e.g.Â __What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?__), etc.\n[**Build upon the basics**]()\nThe picture of the learned whole (as discussed inÂ [Rule 2: Learn before you memorize](https://www.supermemo.com/#Learn%20before%20you%20memorize)) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass. You can always build upon them later on.\nDo not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material [[source](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/articles/theory)]! Basics are usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time. However, each memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly!\n**Stick to theÂ [minimum information principle]()**\nThe material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is[[\"**Simple is easy**\"] [\"By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process it always in the same way. Imagine a labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections being activated at each repetition of complex material\"]]\n**Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule**\nI assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition intervals (as inÂ [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/smintro)). If you consider an item that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent enough to keep the more difficult item in memory. If you split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced students create items that could easily be split intoÂ **ten or more**Â simpler sub-items! Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually remembering it only in part!\nHere is a striking example:\n**Ill-formulated knowledge - Complex and wordy**\nQ: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?\nA: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth's surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters\n**Well-formulated knowledge - Simple and specific**\nQ: Where is the Dead Sea located?\nA:Â **on the border between Israel and Jordan**\nQ: What is the lowest point on the Earth's surface?\nA:Â **The Dead Sea shoreline**\nQ: What is the average level on which the Dead Sea is located?\nA:Â **400 meters**Â (below sea level)\nQ: How long is the Dead Sea?\nA:Â **70 km**\nQ: How much saltier is the Dead Sea than the oceans?\nA:Â **7 times**\nQ: What is the volume content of salt in the Dead Sea?\nA:Â **30%**\nQ: Why can the Dead Sea keep swimmers afloat?\nA:Â **due to high salt content**\nQ: Why is the Dead Sea called Dead?\nA:Â **because only simple organisms can live in it**\nQ: Why only simple organisms can live in the Dead Sea?\nA:Â **because of high salt content**\nYou might want to experiment and try to learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the long perspective, i.e.Â **the longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your items**!\nNote in the example above how short the questions are. Note also that the answers are even shorter! We want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition!Â **We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible**!\nYou will notice that the knowledge learned in the ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well-structured formulation. For example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat, you may forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place! Additionally, rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise.\nYou will also lose the ability to fluently recite the description of the Dead Sea when called up to the blackboard by your teachers. I bet, however, that shining in front of the class is not your ultimate goal in learning. To see how to cope with recitations and poems, read further (section devoted toÂ [enumerations](https://www.supermemo.com/#Enumerations))\n**[Cloze deletion]()Â is easy and effective**\n__Cloze deletionÂ __is a sentence with its parts missing and replaced by three dots.Â __Cloze deletion exercise__Â is an exercise that uses cloze deletion to ask the student to fill in the gaps marked with the three dots. For example,Â __Bill ...[name] was the second US president to go through impeachment.__\nIf you are a beginner and if you find it difficult to stick to the minimum information principle, use cloze deletion! If you are an advanced user, you will also like cloze deletion. It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can be subject to learning based on spaced repetition. Cloze deletion makes the core of the fast reading and learning technique called [[Incremental Reading]](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/read).\n**Ill-formulated knowledge - Complex and wordy**\nQ: What was the history of the Kaleida company?\nA: Kaleida, funded to the tune of $40 million by Apple Computer and IBM in 1991.

It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we sayÂ __one picture is worth a thousand words__. Indeed if you look at the number of details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile.\nUsually it takes much less time to formulate a simple question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.\nThe power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan's mind maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.\n**Less beneficial formulation**\nQ: What African country is located between Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique?\nA: Tanzania\n**More effective formulation**\nQ: What African country is marked white on the map?\n![Tanzania](https://static.supermemo.com/old_articles/articles/http://supermemo.com/images/tanzania.gif)\nA: Tanzania\n**UseÂ [mnemonic techniques]()**\nMnemonic techniques are various techniques that make remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a 10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills!\nBefore you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will needÂ [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/smintro)Â and the compliance with the 20 rules presented herein.\nThere have been dozens of books written about mnemonic techniques. Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can search the web for keywords such as:Â __mind maps, peg lists__,Â __mnemonic techniques__, etc.\nExperience shows that with a dose of training you will need to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With time, using mnemonic techniques will become automatic!\nExemplary mind map:\n![](https://static.supermemo.com/old_articles/articles/http://supermemo.com/images/mindmap.jpg)\n(__Six StepsÂ __mind map generated inÂ [Mind Manager 3.5](http://www.mindman.com/), imported to SuperMemo 2004, courtesy of John England,Â TeamLink Australia)\n**[Graphic deletion]()Â is as good as cloze deletion**\nGraphic deletion works likeÂ [cloze deletion](https://www.supermemo.com/#Cloze%20deletion)Â but instead of a missing phrase it uses a missing image component. For example, when learning anatomy, you might present a complex illustration. Only a small part of it would be missing. The student's job is to name the missing area. The same illustration can be used to formulate 10-20 items! Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image.

The above method makes sure that you reuse the same image many times in all items of the same template.

For example, a set of fruits might be an apple, a pear and a peach. A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks for the list of the members of a set. For example:Â __What countries belong to the European Union?__Â You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them intoÂ [enumerations](https://www.supermemo.com/#Enumerations). Enumerations are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of theÂ [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle):Â **you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition**. In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often. For that reason:Â **Avoid sets!Â **If you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and useÂ [techniques for dealing with enumerations](https://www.supermemo.com/#Enumerations)\n**Ill-formulated knowledge - Sets are unacceptable!**\nQ:[Â What countries belong to the European Union]()Â (2002)?\nA: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom\n**Well-formulated knowledge - Converting a set into a meaningful listing**\nQ: Which country hosted a meeting to consider the creation of a European Community of Defence in 1951?\nA: France\nQ: Which countries apart from France joined the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952?\nA: Germany, Italy and the Benelux\nQ: What countries make up the Benelux?\nA: Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands\nQ: Whose membership did Charles de Gaulle oppose in the 1960s?\nA: that of UK\nQ: Which countries joined the EEC along the UK in 1973?\nA: Ireland and Denmark\nQ: Which country joined the EEC in 1981?\nA: Greece\nQ: Which countries joined the EEC in 1986?\nA: Spain and Portugal\nQ: Which countries joined the EU in 1995?\nA: Austria, Sweden and Finland\nQ: What was the historic course of expansion of the European Union membership?\nA: (1) France and (2) Germany, Italy and the Benelux, (3) UK and (4) Ireland and Denmark, (5) Greece, (6) Spain and Portugal and (7) Austria, Sweden and Finland\nNote that in the example above, we converted a 15-member set into 9 items, five of which are 2-3 member sets, and one is a six member enumeration. Put it to your SuperMemo, and see how easy it is to generate the list of the European Union members using the historic timeline! Note the tricks used with France and the UK. They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to simplify the learning process. Note also that the sum of information included in this well-formulated approach is far greater than that of the original set. Thus along simplicity, we gained some useful knowledge. All individual items effectively comply with theÂ [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle)! You could go further by trying to split the Germany-Italy-Benelux set or using mnemonic techniques to memorize the final seven-member enumeration (i.e. the last of the questions above). However, you should take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the proposed set in memory.\n**[Avoid enumerations]()**\nEnumerations are also an example of classic items that are hard to learn. They are still far more acceptable than sets. Avoid enumerations wherever you can. If you cannot avoid them, deal with them usingÂ [cloze deletions](https://www.supermemo.com/#Cloze%20deletion)Â (overlapping cloze deletions if possible). Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:\n**Hard to learn item**\nQ: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet?\nA: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n**Easy to learn items**\nQ: What three letters does the alphabet begin with?\nA: ABC\nQ: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet A ... ... ... E\nA: B, C, D\nQ: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet B ... ... ... F\nA: C, D, E\nQ: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet C ... ... ... G\nA: D, E, F\nThe above items will make learning the alphabet much faster. The greatest advantage of the above approach is that is it easier for psychological reasons: the student does not have to stop repetitions to recite the whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material. Still it is recommended that he recite the whole alphabetÂ **after**Â making the repetition. However, once all individual pieces are well remembered, reciting the whole should be a pleasant and speedy action that produces little frustration.\nThe cloze deletion used above is an overlapping cloze deletion, i.e. the same parts of the enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for example, the sequence C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy does not contradict theÂ [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle)Â becauseÂ **the extra information is added in extra items**.\nYou can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets (see theÂ [European Union example](https://www.supermemo.com/#EEC)) but cloze deletions should be simpler and should suffice in most cases.\nLearning poems is an example of learning enumerations (all words and sentences have to be uttered in a predefined sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion and without the frustration of forgetting small subcomponents again and again. However, once you notice you stumble with your poem, you should dismember it using cloze deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast, easy, effective and pleasurable\n**A poem that is hard to remember**\nQ: The credit belongs ... ([Teddy Roosevelt](http://www.dropbears.com/b/broughsbooks/qtroosevelt.htm))\nA: The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat; a man who knows the great enthusiasm and the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat\n**A poem split into easy items**\nQ: The credit belongs ...

(The credit belongs)\nA: who in the end knows the triumph of high achievement (so that his place shall never be), etc. etc.\nDoes it all sound artificial? It does! But you will never know how effective this approach is until you try it by yourself!\n**CombatÂ [interference]()**\nWhen you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the wordsÂ __historicÂ __andÂ __historical__. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item, we have a case ofÂ **memory interference**. You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example, if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting. In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.\nInterference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is toÂ **detect and eliminate**. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman and ... aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It very hard to predict.\nStill you should do your best to prevent interference before it takes its toll. This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable. Here are some tips:\nmake items as unambiguous as possible\nstick to theÂ [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle)Â (many of the remaining rules in this text are based on avoiding interference!)\neliminate interference as soon as you spot it, i.e. before it becomes your obsession (e.g. as soon as you see the wordÂ **__inept__**Â you think \"__I know the meanings ofÂ **inept**Â andÂ **inapt**Â but I will never know which is which!\"__)\nin SuperMemo useÂ **[View](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/view)Â :Â **Other browsers :Â **[Leeches](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/leech)__Â __**__(__Shift+__F3__) to regularly review andÂ **eliminateÂ **most difficult items\nread more:Â [Memory interference](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/ol/ks#Univocality)\n[**Optimize wording**]()\nThe wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up. This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.\n**Less optimum item: cloze deletion that is too wordy**\nQ: Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker. Aldus had little competition for years, and so failed to improve. Then Denver-based ... blew past. PageMaker, now owned by Adobe, remains No. 2\nA: Quark\n**Better item: fewer words will speed up learning**\nQ: Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker but failed to improve. Then ... blew past (PageMaker remains No. 2)\nA: Quark\n**Or better:**\nQ: Aldus invented desktop publishing with PageMaker but failed to improve. It was soon outdistanced by ...\nA: Quark\n**Or better:**\nQ: PageMaker failed to improve and was outdistanced by ...\nA: Quark\n**Or better:**\nQ: PageMaker lost ground to ...\nA: Quark\nNote that the loss of information content in this item is inconsequential. During repetition you are only supposed to learn the name:Â __Quark__. You should not hope that the trailing messages on the ownership of PageMaker and the year of its development will somehow trickle to your memory as a side effect. You should decide if the other pieces of information are important to you and if so, store them in separate items (perhaps reusing the above text, employing cloze deletion again and optimizing the wording in a new way). Otherwise the redundant information will only slow down your learning process!\n[**Refer to other memories**]()\nReferring to other memories can place your item in a better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference. In the example below, using the wordsÂ __humble__Â andÂ __supplicant__Â helps the student focus on the wordÂ __shamelessly__Â and thus strengthen the correct semantics. Better focus helps eliminating interference. Secondly, the use of the wordsÂ __humble__Â andÂ __supplicant__Â makes it possible to avoid interference ofÂ __cringingÂ __with these words themselves. Finally, the proposed wording is shorter and more specific. Naturally, the rulesÂ [basics-to-details](https://www.supermemo.com/#Build%20upon%20the%20basics)Â andÂ [do not learn what you do not understand](https://www.supermemo.com/#Do%20not%20learn%20if%20you%20do%20not%20understand)Â require that the wordsÂ __humble__Â andÂ __supplicant__Â be learned beforehand (or at least at the same time)\n**Item subject to strong interference**\nQ: derog: adj: shamelessly conscious of one's failings and asking in a begging way\nA: cringing\n**Item that uses interfering memories to amplify the correct meaning**\nQ: derog: adj: shamelessly humble and supplicant\nA: cringing\n[**Personalize and provide examples**]()\nOne of the most effective ways of enhancing memories is to provide them with a link to your personal life. In the example below you will save time if you use a personal reference rather than trying to paint a picture that would aptly illustrate the question\n**Harder item**\nQ: What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back?\nA: divan\n**Easier item**\nQ: What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back? (like the one at Robert's parents)\nA: divan\nIf you remember exactly what kind of soft bed can be found in Robert's parents' apartment you will save time by not having to dig exactly into the semantics of the definition and/or looking for an appropriate graphic illustration for the piece of furniture in question. Personalized examples are very resistant toÂ [interference](https://www.supermemo.com/#Interference)Â and can greatly reduce your learning time\n[**Rely on emotional states**]()\nIf you can illustrate your items with examples that are vivid or even shocking, you are likely to enhance retrieval (as long as you do not overuse same tools and fall victim of interference!). Your items may assume bizarre form; however, as long as they are produced for your private consumption, the end justifies the means. Use objects that evoke very specific and strong emotions: love, sex, war, your late relative, object of your infatuation, Linda Tripp, Nelson Mandela, etc. It is well known that emotional states can facilitate recall; however, you should make sure that you are not deprived of the said emotional clues at the moment when you need to retrieve a given memory in a real-life situation\n**Harder item**\nQ: a light and joking conversation\nA: banter\n**Easier item**\nQ: a light and joking conversation (e.g. Mandela and de Klerk in 1992)\nA: banter\nIf you have vivid and positive memories related to the meetings between Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, you are likely to quickly grasp the meaning of the definition of banter. Without the example you might struggle with interference from words such asÂ __badinageÂ __or evenÂ __chat__. There is no risk of irrelevant emotional state in this example as the state helps to define the semantics of the learned concept! A well-thought example can often reduce your learning time several times! I have recorded examples in which an item without an example was forgotten 20 times within one year, while the same item with a subtle interference-busting example was not forgotten even once in ten repetitions spread over five years. This is roughly equivalent toÂ **25-fold saving in time in the period of 20 years**! Such examples are not rare! They are most effectively handled with the all the preceding rules targeted onÂ [simplicity](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle)Â and against theÂ [interference](https://www.supermemo.com/#Interference)\n**[Context cuesÂ ]()simplify wording**\nYou can useÂ [categories](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/categs)Â inÂ [SuperMemo 2000/2002](https://www.supermemo.com/), provide different branches of knowledge with a different look (differentÂ [template](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/templates)), use reference labels (__Title, Author, Date,__Â etc.) and clearly label subcategories (e.g. with strings such asÂ __chem__Â forÂ __chemistry__,Â __math__Â forÂ __mathematics__, etc.). This will help you simplify the wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need to specify the context of your question. In the example below, the well-defined prefixÂ __bioch:Â __saves you a lot of typing and a lot of reading while still making sure you do not confuse the abbreviation GRE with Graduate Record Examination. Note that in the recommended case, you process the item starting from the labelÂ __bioch__Â which puts your brain immediately in the right context. While processing the lesser optimum case, you will waste precious milliseconds on flashing the standard meaning of GRE and ... what is worse ... you will light up the wrong areas of your brain that will now perhaps be prone to interference!\n**Wordy item can cause accidental lapses through interference**\nQ: What does GRE stand for in biochemistry?\nA: glucocorticoid response element\n**Context-labeled items increase success rate**\nQ: bioch: GRE\nA: glucocorticoid response element\n**[RedundancyÂ ]()does not contradict minimum information principle**\n**Redundancy**Â in simple terms is more information than needed or duplicate information, etc. Redundancy does not have to contradict theÂ [minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle)Â and may even be welcome. The problem of redundancy is too wide for this short text. Here are some examples that are only to illustrate thatÂ __minimum information principle__Â cannot be understood asÂ __minimum number of characters or bits in your collections or even items__:\n**passive and active approach**: if you learn a foreign language, e.g. Esperanto, you will often build word pairs such asÂ __phone-telefono, language-lingvo, hope-esperanto,Â __etc. These pairs require active recall of the foreign word. Active recall does not, however, guarantee passive recognition and you may fail withÂ __telefono-phone, lingvo-language,Â __orÂ __esperanto-hope.Â __Adding new elements with swapped questions and answers may in some cases be redundant but it does not contradict the minimum information principle! Your items are still as simple as possible. You just get more of them\nInÂ [SuperMemo 2000/2002](https://www.supermemo.com/), you can quickly generate swapped word-pair items withÂ **DuplicateÂ **(__Ctrl+Alt+D__) andÂ **SwapÂ **__(Ctrl+Shift+S)__\n**reasoning cues**: you will often want to boost your reasoning ability by asking about a solution to the problem. Instead of justÂ __memorizing__Â the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation) andÂ __generate__Â the answer. In such a case, providing the hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions\n**derivation steps**: in more complex problems to solve, memorizing individual derivation steps is always highly recommended (e.g. solving complex mathematical problems). It is not cramming! It is making sure that the brain can always follow the fastest path while solving the problem. For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read:Â [Roots of genius and creativity](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/articles/genius), as well as more specific:Â [Derivation, reasoning and intelligence](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/ol/ks#Intelligence)\n**multiple semantic representation**: very often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles. Memorizing different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value. This will increase the expected recall rate (beyond that specified with theÂ [forgetting index](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/fi))!\n**flexible repetition**: if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices. For example, if you learn a language, it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g.Â __a mark made by ink spilt on sth__Â =Â __blot/blob/blotch__)\n[more](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/english/ol/ks#Redundancy)\n**ProvideÂ [sources]()**\nExcept for well-tested and proven knowledge (such asÂ __2+2=4__), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g.Â __Watch out!, Other sources differ!__, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).\n**ProvideÂ [date stamping]()**\nKnowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to memorize stamping itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.\n[**Prioritize**]()\nYou will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long-term. The way you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of learning (e.g. see:Â [learn basics first](https://www.supermemo.com/#Build%20upon%20the%20basics)). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place; only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:\n**Prioritizing sourcesÂ **- there will always be a number of sources of your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals, Internet, TV, newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied sources. As you progress with learning, you will quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others\n**Extracting knowledgeÂ **- unless you are about to pass an important exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles. You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge. You can do it by (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal, (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3) pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo notes, etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master. Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to useÂ [[Incremental Reading]](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/read)Â tools\n**Transferring knowledge to SuperMemoÂ **- you may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo. However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material. Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it\n**Formulating itemsÂ **- make sure that explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the most important part of the item. The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context\n**Using forgetting indexÂ **- you can use theÂ [forgetting index](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/fi)Â to prioritize pending items. The sequence of repetitions will naturally be determined by SuperMemo; however, you can request higher retention level for items that are more important and lower retention level for items of lower priority\n**LearningÂ **- the process of prioritizing does not end with the onset of repetitions. Here are the tools you can use to continue setting your priorities while the learning process is under way:\n**RememberÂ **(__Ctrl+M__) - re-memorize items of high priority that have changed or which are extremely important to your knowledge at a given moment. If you chooseÂ __[Ctrl+M](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/shortcuts)Â __you will be able to determine the next interval for the currently reviewed item (its repetition counter will be reset to zero). It is recommended that you always re-memorize items whose content has changed significantly\n**RescheduleÂ **(__Ctrl+J__) - manually schedule the date of the next repetition\n**Execute repetition**Â (__Ctrl+Shift+R__) - manually execute a repetition even before the repetition's due date (e.g. when reviewing particularly important material)\n**Forget**Â (__Ctrl+R__)__Â __- remove the current item from the learning process and place it at the end of theÂ [pending queue](https://www.supermemo.com/archives1990-2015/help/g#pending_queue)\n**DismissÂ **(__Ctrl+D__)**Â **- ignore the current item in the learning process altogether\n**DeleteÂ **(__Ctrl+Shift+Del__) - remove the current item from your collection\nChange the forgetting index of memorized items or change the ordinal of pending items (__Ctrl+Shift+P__)\n**Summary**\nHere again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules strongly overlap. For example:Â **do not learn if you do not understand**Â is a form of applying theÂ **minimum information principle**Â which again is a way of making things simple:\n[**Do not learn if you do not understand**](https://www.supermemo.com/#Do%20not%20learn%20if%20you%20do%20not%20understand)\n**[Learn before you memorize](https://www.supermemo.com/#Learn%20before%20you%20memorize)Â **- build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!\n**[Build upon the basics](https://www.supermemo.com/#Build%20upon%20the%20basics)Â **- never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in\n[**Stick to the minimum information principle**](https://www.supermemo.com/#minimum%20information%20principle)Â - if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)\n**[Cloze deletion is easy and effective](https://www.supermemo.com/#Cloze%20deletion)Â **- completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners\n**[Use imagery](https://www.supermemo.com/#Use%20imagery)Â **- a picture is worth a thousand words\n**[Use mnemonic techniques](https://www.supermemo.com/#mnemonic%20techniques)Â **- read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures\n**[Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion](https://www.supermemo.com/#Graphic%20deletion)Â **- obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more\n**[Avoid sets](https://www.supermemo.com/#Avoid%20sets)Â **- larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!\n**[Avoid enumerations](https://www.supermemo.com/#Enumerations)Â **- enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion\n**[Combat interference](https://www.supermemo.com/#Interference)Â **- even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life\n**[Optimize wording](https://www.supermemo.com/#Optimize%20wording)Â **- like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims\n**[Refer to other memories](https://www.supermemo.com/#Refer%20to%20other%20memories)Â **- building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps\n**[Personalize and provide examples](https://www.supermemo.com/#Personalize%20and%20provide%20examples)Â **- personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories\n**[Rely on emotional states](https://www.supermemo.com/#Rely%20on%20emotional%20states)Â **- emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering\n**[Context cues simplify wording](https://www.supermemo.com/#Context%20cues)Â **- providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference\n**[Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle](https://www.supermemo.com/#Redundancy)Â **- some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!\n**[Provide sources](https://www.supermemo.com/#sources)Â **- sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance\n**[Provide date stamping](https://www.supermemo.com/#date%20stamping)Â **- time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time\n[**Prioritize**](https://www.supermemo.com/#Prioritize)Â - effective learning is all about prioritizing. InÂ __incremental____Â reading__Â you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation).

These are the successful.\n6.Â As for those who disbelieveâit is the same for them, whether you have warned them, or have not warned themâthey do not believe.\n7.Â God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. They will have a severe torment.\n8.Â Among the people are those who say, âWe believe in God and in the Last Day,â but they are not believers.\n9.Â They seek to deceive God and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, though they are not aware.\n10.Â In their hearts is sickness, and God has increased their sickness. They will have a painful punishment because of their denial.\n11.Â And when it is said to them, âDo not make trouble on earth,â they say, âWe are only reformers.â\n12.Â In fact, they are the troublemakers, but they are not aware.\n13.Â And when it is said to them, âBelieve as the people have believed,â they say, âShall we believe as the fools have believed?â In fact, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.\n14.Â And when they come across those who believe, they say, âWe believeâ; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, âWe are with you; we were only ridiculing.â\n15.Â It is God who ridicules them, and leaves them bewildered in their transgression.\n16.Â Those are they who have bartered error for guidance; but their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.\n17.Â Their likeness is that of a person who kindled a fire; when it illuminated all around him, God took away their light, and left them in darkness, unable to see.\n18.Â Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.\n19.Â Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. But God surrounds the disbelievers.\n20.Â The lightning almost snatches their sight away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, they stand still. Had God willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. God is capable of everything.\n21.Â O people! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may attain piety.\n22.Â He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to God while you know.\n23.Â And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like these, and call your witnesses apart from God, if you are truthful.\n24.Â But if you do notâand you will notâthen beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.\n25.Â And give good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds; that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance, they will say, âThis is what we were provided with before,â and they will be given the like of it. And they will have pure spouses therein, and they will abide therein forever.\n26.Â God does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, âWhat did God intend by this example?â He leads astray many thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He misleads thereby only the evildoers.\n27.Â Those who violate Godâs covenant after its confirmation, and sever what God has commanded to be joined, and commit evil on earth. These are the losers.\n28.Â How can you deny God, when you were dead and He gave you life, then He will put you to death, then He will bring you to life, then to Him you will be returned?\n29.Â It is He who created for you everything on earth, then turned to the heaven, and made them seven heavens. And He is aware of all things.\n30.Â When your Lord said to the angels, âI am placing a successor on earth.â They said, âWill You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?â He said, âI know what you do not know.â\n31.Â And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them to the angels, and said, âTell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.â\n32.Â They said, âGlory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.â\n33.Â He said, âO Adam, tell them their names.â And when he told them their names, He said, âDid I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?â\n34.Â And We said to the angels, âBow down to Adam.â They bowed down, except for Satan. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.\n35.Â We said, âO Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.â\n36.Â But Satan caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they were in. We said, âGo down, some of you enemies of one another. And you will have residence on earth, and enjoyment for a while.â\n37.Â Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him. He is the Relenting, the Merciful.\n38.Â We said, âGo down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidanceâthey have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.\n39.Â But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signsâthese are the inmates of the Fireâwherein they will remain forever.â\n40.Â O Children of Israel! Remember My blessings which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge to you, and fear Me.\n41.Â And believe in what I revealed, confirming what is with you; and do not be the first to deny it; and do not exchange My revelations for a small price; and be conscious of Me.\n42.Â And do not mix truth with falsehood, and do not conceal the truth while you know.\n43.Â And attend to your prayers, and practice regular charity, and kneel with those who kneel.\n44.Â Do you command people to virtuous conduct, and forget yourselves, even though you read the Scripture? Do you not understand?\n45.Â And seek help through patience and prayer. But it is difficult, except for the devout.\n46.Â Those who know that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him they will return.\n47.Â O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you over all nations.\n48.Â And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another in the least, nor will any intercession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any ransom be taken from it, nor will they be helped.\n49.Â And recall that We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you terrible persecution, killing your sons and sparing your women. Therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.\n50.Â And recall that We parted the sea for you, so We saved you, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh as you looked on.\n51.Â And recall that We appointed for Moses forty nights. Then you took to worshiping the calf after him, and you turned wicked.\n52.Â Then We pardoned you after that, so that you might be grateful.\n53.Â And recall that We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.\n54.Â And recall that Moses said to his people, âO my people, you have done wrong to yourselves by worshiping the calf. So repent to your Maker, and kill your egos. That would be better for you with your Maker.â So He turned to you in repentance. He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful.\n55.Â And recall that you said, âO Moses, we will not believe in you unless we see God plainly.â Thereupon the thunderbolt struck you, as you looked on.\n56.Â Then We revived you after your death, so that you may be appreciative.\n57.Â And We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails: âEat of the good things We have provided for you.â They did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong their own souls.\n58.Â And recall that We said, âEnter this town, and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish; but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' We will forgive your sins, and give increase to the virtuous.â\n59.Â But the wrongdoers among them substituted words other than those given to them, so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague from heaven, because of their wicked behavior.\n60.Â And recall when Moses prayed for water for his people. We said, âStrike the rock with your staff.â Thereupon twelve springs gushed out from it, and each tribe recognized its drinking-place. âEat and drink from Godâs provision, and do not corrupt the earth with disobedience.â\n61.Â And recall when you said, âO Moses, we cannot endure one kind of food, so call to your Lord to produce for us of what the earth grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.â He said, âWould you substitute worse for better? Go down to Egypt, where you will have what you asked for.â They were struck with humiliation and poverty, and incurred wrath from God. That was because they rejected Godâs revelations and wrongfully killed the prophets. That was because they disobeyed and transgressed.\n62.Â Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Christians, and the Sabeansâany who believe in God and the Last Day, and act righteouslyâwill have their reward with their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.\n63.Â And recall when We received a pledge from you, and raised the Mount above you: âTake what We have given you earnestly, and remember what is in it, that you may attain righteousness.â\n64.Â But after that you turned away. Were it not for Godâs grace and mercy towards you, you would have been among the losers.\n65.Â And you surely knew those of you who violated the Sabbath. We said to them, âBe despicable apes!â\n66.Â Thus We made it a deterrent for their generation, and for subsequent generations, and a lesson for the righteous.\n67.Â And recall when Moses said to his people, âGod commands you to sacrifice a heifer.â They said, âDo you make a mockery of us?â He said, âGod forbid that I should be so ignorant.â\n68.Â They said, âCall upon your Lord to show us which one.â He said, âHe says she is a heifer, neither too old, nor too young, but in between. So do what you are commanded.â\n69.Â They said, âCall upon your Lord to show us what her color is.â He said, âHe says she is a yellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the beholders.â\n70.Â They said, âCall upon your Lord to show us which one; the heifers look alike to us; and God willing, we will be guided.â\n71.Â He said, âHe says she is a heifer, neither yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the field; sound without blemish.â They said, âNow you have brought the truth.â So they slew her; though they almost did not.\n72.Â And recall when you killed a person, and disputed in the matter; but God was to expose what you were hiding.\n73.Â We said, âStrike him with part of it.â Thus God brings the dead to life; and He shows you His signs, that you may understand.\n74.Â Then after that your hearts hardened. They were as rocks, or even harder. For there are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others that splinter and water comes out from them, and others that sink in awe of God. God is not unaware of what you do.\n75.Â Do you hope that they will believe in you, when some of them used to hear the Word of God, and then deliberately distort it, even after understanding it?\n76.Â And when they come across those who believe, they say, âWe believe,â but when they come together privately, they say, âWill you inform them of what God has disclosed to you, so that they might dispute with you concerning it before your Lord?â Do you not understand?\n77.Â Do they not know that God knows what they conceal and what they reveal?\n78.Â And among them are uneducated who know the Scripture only through hearsay, and they only speculate.\n79.Â So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, âThis is from God,â that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.\n80.Â And they say, âThe Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.â Say, âHave you received a promise from GodâGod never breaks His promiseâor are you saying about God what you do not know?â\n81.Â Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and becomes besieged by his iniquitiesâthese are the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will dwell forever.\n82.Â As for those who believe and do righteous deedsâthese are the inhabitants of Paradise, wherein they will dwell forever.\n83.Â We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: âWorship none but God; and be good to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and the needy; and speak nicely to people; and pray regularly, and give alms.â Then you turned away, except for a few of you, recanting.\n84.Â And We made a covenant with you: âYou shall not shed the blood of your own, nor shall you evict your own from your homes.â You agreed, and were all witnesses.\n85.Â But here you are, killing your own, and expelling a group of your own from their homesâconspiring against them in wrongdoing and hostility. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although it was forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? What is the reward for those among you who do that but humiliation in this life? And on the Day of Resurrection, they will be assigned to the most severe torment. God is not unaware of what you do.\n86.Â Those are they who bought the present life for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.\n87.Â We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a succession of messengers after him. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that whenever a messenger comes to you with anything your souls do not desire, you grew arrogant, calling some impostors, and killing others?\n88.Â And they said, âOur hearts are sealed.â Rather, God has cursed them for their ingratitude. They have little faith.\n89.Â And when a scripture came to them from God, confirming what they haveâalthough previously they were seeking victory against those who disbelievedâbut when there came to them what they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So Godâs curse is upon the disbelievers.\n90.Â Miserable is what they sold their souls forârejecting what God has revealed, out of resentment that God would send down His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants. Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning punishment for the disbelievers.\n91.Â And when it is said to them, âBelieve in what God has revealed,â they say, âWe believe in what was revealed to us,â and they reject anything beyond that, although it is the truth which confirms what they have. Say, âWhy did you kill Godâs prophets before, if you were believers?â\n92.Â Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence, and you were in the wrong.\n93.Â And We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: âTake what We have given you firmly, and listen.â They said, âWe hear and disobey.â And their hearts became filled with the love of the calf because of their disbelief. Say, âWretched is what your faith commands you to do, if you are believers.â\n94.Â Say, âIf the Final Home with God is yours alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.â\n95.Â But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have forwarded. God is aware of the evildoers.\n96.Â You will find them, of all mankind, the most eager for life, even more than the polytheists. Every one of them wishes he could live a thousand years; but to be granted a long life will not nudge him from the punishment. God is Seeing of what they do.\n97.Â Say, âWhoever is hostile to Gabrielâit is he who revealed it to your heart by Godâs leave, confirming what preceded it, and guidance and good news for the believers.â\n98.Â Whoever is hostile to God, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel, and MichaelâGod is hostile to the faithless.\n99.Â We have revealed to you clear signs, and none rejects them except the sinners.\n100.Â Is it not that whenever they make a covenant, some of them toss it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.\n101.Â And when there came to them a messenger from God, confirming what they had, a faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of God behind their backs, as if they do not know.\n102.Â And they followed what the devils taught during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but it was the devils who disbelieved. They taught the people witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon to the two angels Harut and Marut. They did not teach anybody until they had said, âWe are a test, so do not lose faith.â But they learned from them the means to cause separation between man and his wife. But they cannot harm anyone except with God's permission. And they learned what would harm them and not benefit them. Yet they knew that whoever deals in it will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew.\n103.Â Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from God would have been better, if they only knew.\n104.Â O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and listen. The disbelievers will have a painful torment.\n105.Â It is never the wish of the disbelievers from among the People of the Book, nor of the polytheists, that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But God chooses for His mercy whomever He wills. God is Possessor of Sublime Grace.\n106.Â We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be forgotten, unless We bring one better than it, or similar to it. Do you not know that God is capable of all things?\n107.Â Do you not know that to God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and that apart from God you have no guardian or helper?\n108.Â Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed from the right path.\n109.Â Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back into unbelievers after you have believed, out of envy on their part, after the Truth has become clear to them. But pardon and overlook, until God brings His command. God has power over all things.\n110.Â And perform the prayer, and give alms. Whatever good you forward for yourselves, you will find it with God. God is Seeing of everything you do.\n111.Â And they say, âNone will enter Heaven unless he is a Jew or a Christian.â These are their wishes. Say, âProduce your proof, if you are truthful.â\n112.Â In fact, whoever submits himself to God, and is a doer of good, will have his reward with his Lordâthey have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.\n113.Â The Jews say, âThe Christians are not based on anything;â and the Christians say, âThe Jews are not based on anything.â Yet they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ignorant said the same thing. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.\n114.Â Who is more unjust than him who forbids the remembrance of Godâs name in places of worship, and contributes to their ruin? These ought not to enter them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.\n115.Â To God belong the East and the West. Whichever way you turn, there is Godâs presence. God is Omnipresent and Omniscient.\n116.Â And they say, âGod has begotten a son.â Be He glorified. Rather, His is everything in the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him.\n117.Â Originator of the heavens and the earth. Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, âBe,â and it becomes.\n118.Â Those who do not know say, âIf only God would speak to us, or a sign would come to us.â Thus said those who were before them. Their hearts are alike. We have made the signs clear for people who are certain.\n119.Â We have sent you with the truthâbringing good news, and giving warnings. You will not be questioned about the inmates of Hell.\n120.Â The Jews and the Christians will not approve of you, unless you follow their creed. Say, âGodâs guidance is the guidance.â Should you follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have in God neither guardian nor helper.\n121.Â Those to whom We have given the Scripture follow it, as it ought to be followedâthese believe in it. But as for those who reject itâthese are the losers.\n122.Â O Children of Israel! Remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I have favored you over all people.\n123.Â And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another soul in any way, and no ransom will be accepted from it, and no intercession will benefit it, and they will not be helped.\n124.Â And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said, âI am making you a leader of humanity.â He said, âAnd my descendants?â He said, âMy pledge does not include the wrongdoers.â\n125.Â And We made the House a focal point for the people, and a sanctuary. Use the shrine of Abraham as a place of prayer. And We commissioned Abraham and Ishmael, âSanctify My House for those who circle around it, and those who seclude themselves in it, and those who kneel and prostrate.â\n126.Â When Abraham said, âO My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and provide its people with fruitsâwhoever of them believes in God and the Last Day.â He said, âAnd whoever disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, then I will consign him to the punishment of the Fire; how miserable the destiny!â\n127.Â As Abraham raises the foundations of the House, together with Ishmael, âOur Lord, accept it from us, You are the Hearer, the Knower.\n128.Â Our Lord, and make us submissive to You, and from our descendants a community submissive to You. And show us our rites, and accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.\n129.Â Our Lord, and raise up among them a messenger, of themselves, who will recite to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Almighty, the Wise.â\n130.Â Who would forsake the religion of Abraham, except he who fools himself? We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.\n131.Â When his Lord said to him, âSubmit!â He said, âI have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds.â\n132.Â And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Jacob, âO my sons, God has chosen this religion for you, so do not die unless you have submitted.â\n133.Â Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, and he said to his sons, âWhat will you worship after Me?â They said, âWe will worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; One God; and to Him we submit.â\n134.Â That was a community that has passed; for them is what they have earned, and for you is what you have earned; and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.\n135.Â And they say, âBe Jews or Christians, and you will be guided.â Say, âRather, the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an idolater.â\n136.Â Say, âWe believe in God; and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the prophetsâfrom their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we surrender.â\n137.Â If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been guided. But if they turn away, then they are in schism. God will protect you against them; for He is the Hearer, the Knower.\n138.Â Godâs coloring. And who gives better coloring than God? âAnd we are devoted to Him.â\n139.Â Say, âDo you argue with us about God, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?â\n140.Â Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or Christians? Say, âDo you know better, or God?â And who does greater wrong than he who conceals a testimony he has from God? God is not unaware of what you do.\n141.Â That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to you is what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they used to do.\n142.Â The ignorant among the people will say, âWhat has turned them away from the direction of prayer they once followed?â Say, âTo God belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.â\n143.Â Thus We made you a moderate community, that you may be witnesses to humanity, and that the Messenger may be a witness to you. We only established the direction of prayer, which you once followed, that We may distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels. It is indeed difficult, except for those whom God has guided. But God would never let your faith go to waste. God is Kind towards the people, Merciful.\n144.Â We have seen your face turned towards the heaven. So We will turn you towards a direction that will satisfy you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Book know that it is the Truth from their Lord; and God is not unaware of what they do.\n145.Â Even if you were to bring to those who were given the Book every proof, they would not follow your direction, nor are you to follow their direction, nor do they follow the direction of one another. And if you were to follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you would be in that case one of the wrongdoers.\n146.Â Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own children. But some of them conceal the truth while they know.\n147.Â The truth is from your Lord, so do not be a skeptic.\n148.Â To every community is a direction towards which it turns. Therefore, race towards goodness. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together. God is capable of everything.\n149.Â And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the truth from your Lord, and God is not heedless of what you do.\n150.Â And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it. So that the people may not have any argument against youâexcept those who do wrong among them. So do not fear them, but fear Me, that I may complete My blessings upon you, and that you may be guided.\n151.Â Just as We sent to you a messenger from among you, who recites Our revelations to you, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you did not know.\n152.Â So remember Me, and I will remember you. And thank Me, and do not be ungrateful.\n153.Â O you who believe! Seek help through patience and prayers. God is with the steadfast.\n154.Â And do not say of those who are killed in the cause of God, âDead.â Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive.\n155.Â We will certainly test you with some fear and hunger, and some loss of possessions and lives and crops. But give good news to the steadfast.\n156.Â Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, say, âTo God we belong, and to Him we will return.â\n157.Â Upon these are blessings and mercy from their Lord. These are the guided ones.\n158.Â Safa and Marwa are among the rites of God. Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House, or performs the Umrah, commits no error by circulating between them. Whoever volunteers goodâGod is Appreciative and Cognizant.\n159.Â Those who suppress the proofs and the guidance We have revealed, after We have clarified them to humanity in the ScriptureâthoseâGod curses them, and the cursers curse them.\n160.Â Except those who repent, and reform, and proclaim. ThoseâI will accept their repentance. I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.\n161.Â But as for those who reject faith, and die rejectingâthoseâupon them is the curse of God, and of the angels, and of all humanity.\n162.Â They will remain under it forever, and the torment will not be lightened for them, and they will not be reprieved.\n163.Â Your God is one God. There is no god but He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.\n164.Â In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind; in the water that God sends down from the sky, and revives the earth with it after it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of creatures; in the changing of the winds, and the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who understand.\n165.Â Yet among the people are those who take other than God as equals to Him. They love them as the love of God. But those who believe have greater love for God. If only the wrongdoers would realize, when they see the torment; that all power is Godâs, and that God is severe in punishment.\n166.Â Those who were followed will then disown those who followed them, and they will see the retribution, and ties between them will be severed.\n167.Â Those who followed will say, âIf only we can have another chance, we will disown them, as they disowned us.â Thus God will show them their deeds, as regrets to them, and they will not come out of the Fire.\n168.Â O people! Eat of what is lawful and good on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an open enemy.\n169.Â He commands you to do evil and vice, and to say about God what you do not know.\n170.Â And when it is said to them, âFollow what God has revealed,â they say, âWe will follow what we found our ancestors following.â Even if their ancestors understood nothing, and were not guided?\n171.Â The parable of those who disbelieve is that of someone who calls upon someone who hears nothing except screaming and yelling. Deaf, dumb, and blindâthey do not understand.\n172.Â O you who believe! Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give thanks to God, if it is Him that you serve.\n173.Â He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and what was dedicated to other than God. But if anyone is compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he commits no sin. God is Forgiving and Merciful.\n174.Â Those who conceal what God revealed in the Book, and exchange it for a small priceâthose swallow nothing but fire into their bellies. And God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment.\n175.Â It is they who exchange guidance for error, and forgiveness for punishment. But why do they insist on the Fire?\n176.Â That is because God has revealed the Book in truth; and those who differ about the Book are in deep discord.\n177.Â Righteousness does not consist of turning your faces towards the East and the West. But righteous is he who believes in God, and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, and the prophets. Who gives money, though dear, to near relatives, and orphans, and the needy, and the homeless, and the beggars, and for the freeing of slaves; those who perform the prayers, and pay the obligatory charity, and fulfill their promise when they promise, and patiently persevere in the face of persecution, hardship, and in the time of conflict. These are the sincere; these are the pious.\n178.Â O you who believe! Retaliation for the murdered is ordained upon you: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female. But if he is forgiven by his kin, then grant any reasonable demand, and pay with good will. This is a concession from your Lord, and a mercy. But whoever commits aggression after that, a painful torment awaits him.\n179.Â There is life for you in retaliation, O people of understanding, so that you may refrain.\n180.Â It is decreed for you: when death approaches one of you, and he leaves wealth, to make a testament in favor of the parents and the relatives, fairly and correctlyâa duty upon the righteous.\n181.Â But whoever changes it after he has heard it, the guilt is upon those who change it. God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\n182.Â Should someone suspect bias or injustice on the part of a testator, and then reconciles between them, he commits no sin. God is Forgiving and Merciful.\n183.Â O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become righteous.\n184.Â For a specified number of days. But whoever among you is sick, or on a journey, then a number of other days. For those who are able: a ransom of feeding a needy person. But whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.\n185.Â Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed. Guidance for humanity, and clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. Whoever of you witnesses the month, shall fast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey, then a number of other days. God desires ease for you, and does not desire hardship for you, that you may complete the number, and celebrate God for having guided you, so that you may be thankful.\n186.Â And when My servants ask you about Me, I Am near; I answer the call of the caller when he calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and have faith in Me, that they may be rightly guided.\n187.Â Permitted for you is intercourse with your wives on the night of the fast. They are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them. God knows that you used to betray yourselves, but He turned to you and pardoned you. So approach them now, and seek what God has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white streak of dawn can be distinguished from the black streak. Then complete the fast until nightfall. But do not approach them while you are in retreat at the mosques. These are the limits of God, so do not come near them. God thus clarifies His revelations to the people, that they may attain piety.\n188.Â And do not consume one anotherâs wealth by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the officials in order to consume part of other peopleâs wealth illicitly, while you know.\n189.Â They ask you about the crescents. Say, âThey are timetables for people, and for the Hajj.â It is not virtuous that you approach homes from their backs, but virtue is to be pious. So approach homes from their doors, and observe God, that you may succeed.\n190.Â And fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not commit aggression; God does not love the aggressors.\n191.Â And kill them wherever you overtake them, and expel them from where they had expelled you. Oppression is more serious than murder. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque, unless they fight you there. If they fight you, then kill them. Such is the retribution of the disbelievers.\n192.Â But if they cease, then God is Forgiving and Merciful.\n193.Â And fight them until there is no oppression, and worship becomes devoted to God alone. But if they cease, then let there be no hostility except against the oppressors.\n194.Â The sacred month for the sacred month; and sacrilege calls for retaliation. Whoever commits aggression against you, retaliate against him in the same measure as he has committed against you. And be conscious of God, and know that God is with the righteous.\n195.Â And spend in the cause of God, and do not throw yourselves with your own hands into ruin, and be charitable. God loves the charitable.\n196.Â And carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for God. But if you are prevented, then whatever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave your heads until the offering has reached its destination. Whoever of you is sick, or has an injury of the head, then redemption of fasting, or charity, or worship. When you are secure: whoever continues the Umrah until the Hajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. But if he lacks the means, then fasting for three days during the Hajj and seven when you have returned, making ten in all. This is for he whose household is not present at the Sacred Mosque. And remain conscious of God, and know that God is stern in retribution.\n197.Â The Hajj is during specific months. Whoever decides to perform the Hajjâthere shall be no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor quarrelling during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, God knows it. And take provisions, but the best provision is righteousness. And be mindful of Me, O people of understanding.\n198.Â You commit no error by seeking bounty from your Lord. When you disperse from Arafat, remember God at the Sacred Landmark. And remember Him as He has guided you. Although, before that, you were of those astray.\n199.Â Then disperse from where the people disperse, and ask God for forgiveness. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n200.Â When you have completed your rites, remember God as you remember your parents, or even more. Among the people is he who says, âOur Lord, give us in this world,â yet he has no share in the Hereafter.\n201.Â And among them is he who says, âOur Lord, give us goodness in this world, and goodness in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.â\n202.Â These will have a share of what they have earned. God is swift in reckoning.\n203.Â And remember God during the designated days. But whoever hurries on in two days commits no wrong, and whoever stays on commits no wrongâprovided he maintains righteousness. And obey God, and know that to Him you will be gathered.\n204.Â Among the people is he whose speech about the worldly life impresses you, and he calls God to witness what is in his heart, while he is the most hostile of adversaries.\n205.Â When he gains power, he strives to spread corruption on earth, destroying properties and lives. God does not like corruption.\n206.Â And when he is told, âBeware of God,â his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is enough for himâa dreadful abode.\n207.Â And among the people is he who sells himself seeking Godâs approval. God is kind towards the servants.\n208.Â O you who believe! Enter into submission, wholeheartedly, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; he is to you an outright enemy.\n209.Â But if you slip after the proofs have come to you, know that God is Powerful and Wise.\n210.Â Are they waiting for God Himself to come to them in the shadows of the clouds, together with the angels, and thus the matter is settled? All things are returned to God.\n211.Â Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. Whoever alters the blessing of God after it has come to himâGod is severe in retribution.\n212.Â Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they ridicule those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. God provides to whomever He wills without measure.\n213.Â Humanity used to be one community; then God sent the prophets, bringing good news and giving warnings. And He sent down with them the Scripture, with the truth, to judge between people regarding their differences. But none differed over it except those who were given itâafter the proofs had come to themâout of mutual envy between them. Then God guided those who believed to the truth they had disputed, in accordance with His will. God guides whom He wills to a straight path.\n214.Â Or do you expect to enter Paradise before the example of those who came before you had reached you? Adversity and hardship had afflicted them, and they were so shaken up, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said, âWhen is Godâs victory?â Indeed, Godâs victory is near.\n215.Â They ask you what they should give. Say, âWhatever charity you give is for the parents, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you do, God is aware of it.\n216.Â Fighting is ordained for you, even though you dislike it. But it may be that you dislike something while it is good for you, and it may be that you like something while it is bad for you. God knows, and you do not know.\n217.Â They ask you about fighting during the Holy Month. Say, âFighting during it is deplorable; but to bar others from Godâs path, and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent access to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people from it, are more deplorable with God. And persecution is more serious than killing. They will not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can. Whoever among you turns back from his religion, and dies a disbelieverâthose are they whose works will come to nothing, in this life, and in the Hereafter. Those are the inmates of the Fire, abiding in it forever.\n218.Â Those who believed, and those who migrated and fought for the sake of Godâthose look forward to Godâs mercy. God is Forgiving and Merciful.\n219.Â They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, âThere is gross sin in them, and some benefits for people, but their sinfulness outweighs their benefit.â And they ask you about what they should give: say, âThe surplus.â Thus God explains the revelations to you, so that you may think.\n220.Â About this world and the next. And they ask you about orphans. Say, âImprovement for them is best. And if you intermix with them, then they are your brethren.â God knows the dishonest from the honest. Had God willed, He could have overburdened you. God is Mighty and Wise.\n221.Â Do not marry idolatresses, unless they have believed. A believing maid is better than an idolatress, even if you like her. And do not marry idolaters, unless they have believed. A believing servant is better than an idolater, even if you like him. These call to the Fire, but God calls to the Garden and to forgiveness, by His leave. He makes clear His communications to the people, that they may be mindful.\n222.Â And they ask you about menstruation: say, âIt is harmful, so keep away from women during menstruation. And do not approach them until they have become pure. Once they have become pure, approach them in the way God has directed you.â God loves the repentant, and He loves those who keep clean.â\n223.Â Your women are cultivation for you; so approach your cultivation whenever you like, and send ahead for yourselves. And fear God, and know that you will meet Him. And give good news to the believers.\n224.Â And do not allow your oaths in God's name to hinder you from virtue, and righteousness, and making peace between people. God is Listener and Knower.\n225.Â God does not hold you responsible for your unintentional oaths, but He holds you responsible for your intentions. God is Forgiving and Forbearing.\n226.Â Those who vow abstinence from their wives must wait for four months. But if they reconcileâGod is Forgiving and Merciful.\n227.Â And if they resolve to divorceâGod is Hearing and Knowing.\n228.Â Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods. And it is not lawful for them to conceal what God has created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the Last Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have the better right to take them back, if they desire reconciliation. And women have rights similar to their obligations, according to what is fair. But men have a degree over them. God is Mighty and Wise.\n229.Â Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either honorable retention, or setting free kindly. It is not lawful for you to take back anything you have given them, unless they fear that they cannot maintain God's limits. If you fear that they cannot maintain Godâs limits, then there is no blame on them if she sacrifices something for her release. These are Godâs limits, so do not transgress them. Those who transgress Godâs limits are the unjust.\n230.Â If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful for him again until she has married another husband. If the latter divorces her, then there is no blame on them for reuniting, provided they think they can maintain God's limits. These are Godâs limits; He makes them clear to people who know.\n231.Â When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, either retain them amicably, or release them amicably. But do not retain them to hurt them and commit aggression. Whoever does that has wronged himself. And do not take Godâs revelations for a joke. And remember God's favor to you, and that He revealed to you the Scripture and Wisdom to teach you. And fear God, and know that God is aware of everything.\n232.Â When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands, provided they agree on fair terms. Thereby is advised whoever among you believes in God and the Last Day. That is better and more decent for you. God knows, and you do not know.\n233.Â Mothers may nurse their infants for two whole years, for those who desire to complete the nursing-period. It is the duty of the father to provide for them and clothe them in a proper manner. No soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity. No mother shall be harmed on account of her child, and no father shall be harmed on account of his child. The same duty rests upon the heir. If the couple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no error by doing so. You commit no error by hiring nursing-mothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And be wary of God, and know that God is Seeing of what you do.\n234.Â As for those among you who die and leave widows behind, their widows shall wait by themselves for four months and ten days. When they have reached their term, there is no blame on you regarding what they might honorably do with themselves. God is fully acquainted with what you do.\n235.Â You commit no error by announcing your engagement to women, or by keeping it to yourselves. God knows that you will be thinking about them. But do not meet them secretly, unless you have something proper to say. And do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled. And know that God knows what is in your souls, so beware of Him. And know that God is Forgiving and Forbearing.\n236.Â You commit no error by divorcing women before having touched them, or before having set the dowry for them. And compensate themâthe wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his meansâwith a fair compensation, a duty upon the doers of good.\n237.Â If you divorce them before you have touched them, but after you had set the dowry for them, give them half of what you specifiedâunless they forego the right, or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. But to forego is nearer to piety. And do not forget generosity between one another. God is seeing of everything you do.\n238.Â Guard your prayers, and the middle prayer, and stand before God in devotion.\n239.Â But if you are in fear, then on foot, or riding. And when you are safe, remember God, as He taught you what you did not know.\n240.Â Those of you who die and leave wives behindâa will shall provide their wives with support for a year, provided they do not leave. If they leave, you are not to blame for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. God is Mighty and Wise.\n241.Â And divorced women shall be provided for, equitablyâa duty upon the righteous.\n242.Â God thus explains His revelations to you, so that you may understand.\n243.Â Have you not considered those who fled their homes, by the thousands, fearful of death? God said to them, âDie.â Then He revived them. God is Gracious towards the people, but most people are not appreciative.\n244.Â Fight in the cause of God, and know that God is Hearing and Knowing.\n245.Â Who is he who will offer God a generous loan, so He will multiply it for him manifold? God receives and amplifies, and to Him you will be returned.\n246.Â Have you not considered the notables of the Children of Israel after Moses? When they said to a prophet of theirs, âAppoint a king for us, and we will fight in the cause of God.â He said, âIs it possible that, if fighting was ordained for you, you would not fight?â They said, âWhy would we not fight in the cause of God, when we were driven out of our homes, along with our children?â But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. But God is aware of the wrongdoers.\n247.Â Their prophet said to them, âGod has appointed Saul to be your king.â They said, âHow can he have authority over us, when we are more worthy of authority than he, and he was not given plenty of wealth?â He said, âGod has chosen him over you, and has increased him in knowledge and stature.â God bestows His sovereignty upon whomever He wills. God is Embracing and Knowing.\n248.Â And their prophet said to them, âThe proof of his kingship is that the Ark will be restored to you, bringing tranquility from your Lord, and relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron. It will be carried by the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you are believers.â\n249.Â When Saul set out with the troops, he said, âGod will be testing you with a river. Whoever drinks from it does not belong with me. But whoever does not drink from it, does belong with me, except for whoever scoops up a little with his hand.â But they drank from it, except for a few of them. Then, when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, âWe have no strength to face Goliath and his troops today.â But those who knew that they would meet God said, âHow many a small group has defeated a large group by Godâs will. God is with the steadfast.â\n250.Â And when they confronted Goliath and his troops, they said, âOur Lord, pour down patience on us, and strengthen our foothold, and support us against the faithless people.â\n251.Â And they defeated them by Godâs leave, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as He willed. Were it not for God restraining the people, some by means of others, the earth would have gone to ruin. But God is gracious towards mankind.\n252.Â These are Godâs revelations, which We recite to you in truth. You are one of the messengers.\n253.Â These messengers: We gave some advantage over others. To some of them God spoke directly, and some He raised in rank. We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear miracles, and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Had God willed, those who succeeded them would not have fought one another, after the clear signs had come to them; but they disputed; some of them believed, and some of them disbelieved. Had God willed, they would not have fought one another; but God does whatever He desires.\n254.Â O you who believe! Spend from what We have given you, before a Day comes in which there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor intercession. The disbelievers are the wrongdoers.\n255.Â God! There is no god except He, the Living, the Everlasting. Neither slumber overtakes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what is before them, and what is behind them; and they cannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. He is the Most High, the Great.\n256.Â There shall be no compulsion in religion; the right way has become distinct from the wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy handle; which does not break. God is Hearing and Knowing.\n257.Â God is the Lord of those who believe; He brings them out of darkness and into light. As for those who disbelieve, their lords are the evil ones; they bring them out of light and into darknessâthese are the inmates of the Fire, in which they will abide forever.\n258.Â Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him sovereignty? Abraham said, âMy Lord is He who gives life and causes death.â He said, âI give life and cause death.â Abraham said, âGod brings the sun from the East, so bring it from the West,â so the blasphemer was confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n259.Â Or like him who passed by a town collapsed on its foundations. He said, âHow can God revive this after its demise?â Thereupon God caused him to die for a hundred years, and then resurrected him. He said, âFor how long have you tarried?â He said, âI have tarried for a day, or part of a day.â He said, âNo. You have tarried for a hundred years. Now look at your food and your drinkâit has not spoiledâand look at your donkey. We will make you a wonder for mankind. And look at the bones, how We arrange them, and then clothe them with flesh.â So when it became clear to him, he said, âI know that God has power over all things.â\n260.Â And when Abraham said, âMy Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.â He said, âHave you not believed?â He said, âYes, but to put my heart at ease.â He said, âTake four birds, and incline them to yourself, then place a part on each hill, then call to them; and they will come rushing to you. And know that God is Powerful and Wise.â\n261.Â The parable of those who spend their wealth in Godâs way is that of a grain that produces seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. God multiplies for whom He wills. God is Bounteous and Knowing.\n262.Â Those who spend their wealth in the way of God, and then do not follow up what they spent with reminders of their generosity or with insults, will have their reward with their Lordâthey have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.\n263.Â Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by insults. God is Rich and Clement.\n264.Â O you who believe! Do not nullify your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words, like him who spends his wealth to be seen by the people, and does not believe in God and the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, and leaves it bareâthey gain nothing from their efforts. God does not guide the disbelieving people.\n265.Â And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Godâs approval, and to strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on a hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then dew is enough. God is seeing of everything you do.\n266.Â Would anyone of you like to have a garden of palms and vines, under which rivers flowâwith all kinds of fruit in it for him, and old age has stricken him, and he has weak childrenâthen a tornado with fire batters it, and it burns down? Thus God makes clear the signs for you, so that you may reflect.\n267.Â O you who believe! Give of the good things you have earned, and from what We have produced for you from the earth. And do not pick the inferior things to give away, when you yourselves would not accept it except with eyes closed. And know that God is Sufficient and Praiseworthy.\n268.Â Satan promises you poverty, and urges you to immorality; but God promises you forgiveness from Himself, and grace. God is Embracing and Knowing.\n269.Â He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. Whoever is given wisdom has been given much good. But none pays heed except those with insight.\n270.Â Whatever charity you give, or a pledge you fulfill, God knows it. The wrongdoers have no helpers.\n271.Â If you give charity openly, that is good. But if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy in private, that is better for you. It will atone for some of your misdeeds. God is cognizant of what you do.\n272.Â Their guidance is not your responsibility, but God guides whom He wills. Any charity you give is for your own good. Any charity you give shall be for the sake of God. Any charity you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.\n273.Â It is for the poor; those who are restrained in the way of God, and unable to travel in the land. The unaware would think them rich, due to their dignity. You will recognize them by their features. They do not ask from people insistently. Whatever charity you give, God is aware of it.\n274.Â Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately and publicly, will receive their reward from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.\n275.Â Those who swallow usury will not rise, except as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. That is because they say, âCommerce is like usury.â But God has permitted commerce, and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may keep his past earnings, and his case rests with God. But whoever resumesâthese are the dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide forever.\n276.Â God condemns usury, and He blesses charities. God does not love any sinful ingrate.\n277.Â Those who believe, and do good deeds, and pray regularly, and give charityâthey will have their reward with their Lord; they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.\n278.Â O you who believe! Fear God, and forgo what remains of usury, if you are believers.\n279.Â If you do not, then take notice of a war by God and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may keep your capital, neither wronging, nor being wronged.\n280.Â But if he is in hardship, then deferment until a time of ease. But to remit it as charity is better for you, if you only knew.\n281.Â And guard yourselves against a Day when you will be returned to God; then each soul will be rewarded fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.\n282.Â O you who believe! When you incur debt among yourselves for a certain period of time, write it down. And have a scribe write in your presence, in all fairness. And let no scribe refuse to write, as God has taught him. So let him write, and let the debtor dictate. And let him fear God, his Lord, and diminish nothing from it. But if the debtor is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate with honesty. And call to witness two men from among you. If two men are not available, then one man and two women whose testimony is acceptable to allâif one of them fails to remember, the other would remind her. Witnesses must not refuse when called upon. And do not think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, including the time of repayment. That is more equitable with God, and stronger as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubtâexcept in the case of a spot transaction between youâthen there is no blame on you if you do not write it down. And let there be witnesses whenever you conclude a contract, and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is corruption on your part. And fear God. God teaches you. God is aware of everything.\n283.Â If you are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit should be handed over. But if you trust one another, let the trustee fulfill his trust, and let him fear God, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. Whoever conceals it is sinner at heart. God is aware of what you do.\n284.Â To God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is within your selves, or conceal it, God will call you to account for it. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. God is Able to do all things.\n285.Â The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, as did the believers. They all have believed in God, and His angels, and His scriptures, and His messengers: âWe make no distinction between any of His messengers.â And they say, âWe hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our Lord. To you is the destiny.â\n286.Â God does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. To its credit is what it earns, and against it is what it commits. âOur Lord, do not condemn us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have burdened those before us. Our Lord, do not burden us with more than we have strength to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Lord and Master, so help us against the disbelieving people.â\nDemoing [[Encryption]] #[[New Features]] \nEncrypted blocks are now live on Roam\nTo use them type `{{``encrypt}}`\nExample:: {{encrypt:U2FsdGVkX19IGq42nYT82SQysswn/KYSMDPTJFTe/OV3lmF0BBO1MRb54tBZFZAr}} \nThen choose a hint and passphrase for that block\nThe passphrase for this [block](((RsNzjvI5f))) is `test` \nclicking the lock - or the text area will show you what the sting looks like when sent to us\nonly the hint is stored with Roam - the passphrase never goes to our servers\nWARNING\nif you edit the text of the encrypted string - you will likely lose all of the data (only edit it when it is decrypted)\nMarkdown links can be used as aliases for [[Block References]] and [[Bidirectional Links]] #[[New Features]] \nAll Men are Mortal\nSocrates is Mortal\nIf [x](((DjhGC4Ppy))) then [y](((YdZn32tkw))) \nrefresh your page if you don't see this ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FAIEro4drl0?alt=media&token=91e6c400-e244-4e16-8c3c-aff180ffb19b)\nExample with aliases for pages\n I have a page for [[Writers]]\nand I want to talk about how \n[[Paul Graham]] [wrote]([[Writers]]) [[The Age of the Essay]]\nor [germans]([[Germany]])    \nExamples of multi-word\n[ISAs]([[Income Share Agreements]])\ntest whether this appears [x](((XFgHjPHJy)))\n#[[New Features]] - [[Query]] component\nHow it works\n```\n{{query: {and: [[TODO]] \n          {not: \n           {or: [[Example]] [[Demo]]}}}}\n\nwill return all TODOs \n that are not also tagged with Example or Demo\n```\n**TODOs which are not Demos or Examples** {{[[query]]: {and: [[TODO]] {not: {or: [[Demo]] [[Example]]}}}}}\nHow to write [Queries in Roam]([[Query]])\nThere are three logical operators \nand\nor\nnot\nA query can look for block or page references\nQueries look like this\n`{` {{or: or: | not: | and:}}  {{or: ((65J8uNv6D))} | [[Example]]}} `}`\nbut they can compose\nso you can have\n```{{query: {and: [[Questions]] {:not [[important]]}}}}```\ngets you Questions that are not important\n```{{query: {or: [[backlinks]] [[Precise Links]]}}}```\ngets you blocks that are tagged with backlinks OR precise links\n{{embed: ((1ZG0Y-Nys))}}\nhttps://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1226658292333568003?s=20\nThis week [[Calendar View]] {{table}}\nSun\nMon\nTues\nWed\nThur\nFri\nSat\n{{query: {and: [[February 9th, 2020]]}}}\n{{query: {and: [[February 10th, 2020]]}}}\n{{query: {and: [[February 11th, 2020]]}}}\n{{query: {and: [[February 12th, 2020]]}}}\n{{query: {and: [[February 13th, 2020]]}}}\n{{query: {and: [[February 14th, 2020]]}}}\n{{query: {and: [[February 15th, 2020]]}}}\n[[Kanban Experiment]]\nRound 1\nCore Idea::  Have a query for your todos next to the kanban board, then drag items from their original location into the board\n{{kanban}}\nBacklog\nThis item\nDOING\nDONE\nResults::\nCurrently we aren't parsing the blocks in kanban -- need to do that for this to be useful.\nalso - would be good for tags + filters to respect info added to a block via its references.\n{{query: {and: [[TODO]]}}}}\nRound 2\nAutomated Kanban\n{{table}}\n**TODO** {{[[query]]: {and: [[TODO]] [[kb]] {not: {or: [[scheduled]] [[query]]}}}}}\n**DOING** {{[[query]]: {and: [[TODO]] [[kb]] [[scheduled]] {not: [[query]]}}}}\n**DONE** {{[[query]]: {and: [[DONE]] [[kb]] {not: [[query]]}}}}\nTasks\n{{[[TODO]]}} Upcoming kb item #kb #scheduled [[April 18th, 2020]]\n{{[[DONE]]}} do this thing tomorrow [[February 12th, 2020]] #scheduled #kb\n{{[[TODO]]}} #kb do This thing is done\n{{[[DONE]]}}  ptu this on the #kb \n#Home\n#Kitchen\nRecycling bins\nSoap trays for sink\nSpice rack/shelf\nBins for organizing snacks\n#Bedroom\nBook shelves\n#Kids\nBath toy organizer and storage\n#Groceries\n02:49\n[[Morning Pages]] {{word-count}} \n02:49 - 03:08 (19 min) 583 words\nCouldn't sleep, so I'll blog a bit here.\nWas thinking about how it feels incredibly easy to put completely unfiltered (well, everything is filtered if at least by your subconcious) thoughts on this page - but it was so legitimately physically stressful to try to answer [[Anne]]'s interview questions over email.

I am being asked to introduce myself to an unfamiliar audience - they are being __forced__ in a sense to listen to me talk about myself - because someone they trust is interested, versus coming to my house (this public Roamblog is in a sense __my__ house, and is cluttered and free the way I like it to be) out of their own volition, because they already have some interest in what I'm thinking about.  -- somehow the audience here feels like it is more friendly / hospitable than an audience I don't know much about yet.\n2. On this site, I can change things, I can delete things, I can add to them and give additional context.  I don't have any pressure to be concise, or get to the point.

I'm writing in public here because I know there are at least a few people who enjoy hearing my thoughts about these sorts of things [*](((hczwHaltk)))\nIn this case, I think that the relevance of thinking about my relative stress levels on different mediums / frames relates to long term decisions we'll be making with respect to [[Multi-User]] Roam\nFor instance - **if** the things that makes me more comfortable with writing here is that [a](((o7-GDaoD8))) and [b](((pTBwfl6aN)))\nI am free to delete content later\nI am free to give additional detail or clarity or context later\nThen\nWe should really be thinking carefully about the idea of someone else \"cloning\" someone else's notes into their database and maintaining attribution - without ability of the original author to retract or change their mind, or add additional context\n{{[[TODO]]}} The Command-K insertion is really not ergonomic - it should put you first in the `[]`\n{{[[TODO]]}} and then with enter or tab it should move to you the `( )`\n03:08 - 03:16 (8 min)\nProbably almost ready to get back to sleep - but tempted to do a bit of a draft on [[Anne]]'s questions here\nI think my preference would probably be for her to write up her own thoughts about Roam for the newsletter, and then just link the readers to these answers -- or to the twitter threads I included in my initial response to her - so that it can open up conversation.\n{{[[TODO]]}} Change open/close blocks to be handled by each user in local state - but to default to the open/close setting of the author of the post...\nIf there are 1000 readers on a single Roam-blog we wouldn't want to have to store an open/close state for every one of those readers - but it would be good - though not essential - to be able to persist each reader's open/close setting between sessions\nThe simplest change to make is to say that only editors are firing open/close blocks - and that blocks for **readers** are being stored locally.\n{{[[TODO]]}} definitely going to want to have some sort of special page or special type of block where only the author of the content is able to edit their content\ndefinitely feels like it relates to long term multiplayer goals.\n03:16 -- 03:20\nclean kitchen - planning on going to sleep - thinking about the question of ((78e1zMhiI))\n03:21 - 04:16 \n**Youâ âhaveâ âbeenâ âworkingâ âonâ âRoamâ âforâ âyearsâ ânow.â âWhatâ âinspiredâ âyouâ âtoâ âstartâ âbuildingâ âthisâÂ âproduct?â**\nHard to give a concrete answer to this - especially since [[Eureka Moments]] are a total fiction when it comes to new ideas and innovation\nI totally buy [[Steven B Johnson]]'s claims about the [[Slow Hunch]] - that all good ideas emerge from folks living at the [[Adjacent Possible]], and that they often take years to crystalize.\nStill, the fiction is relevant, you have to decide after the fact that a few moments/observations were more important than others are are going to be the ones you imbue meaning into - so it is probably worthwhile choosing a few moments that stand out.\nA couple\nPossibility\nSeeing that Wikipedia and Open Source Software were instances of a more general pattern -- [[Commons Based Peer Production]] and that each had been enabled by a new collaboration medium (wikis and git respectivly) that was very different from anything that existed before the internet -- I got this from [[Yochai Benkler]]'s 2005 TED talk.\nThat observation gave me the sense that there were going to be a lot of other possible [[Wikipedia Scale]] global collaboration projects - and that the thing you needed to do to enable them was to create infrastructure for new kinds of collaboration and large group coordination.\nso this posed a question - What are the Wikipedias we would want to have 100 years from now - what technology (social and technological) would have to be invented in order for those sort of projects to be viable. \nrelated to that question is the ((bxWvKjPuJ))\nProblem\nall of our [[Sense Making Institions]] - Media, Academic Publishing (both in the form of journals and in textbooks), even policy making and governance - law -- they're all basically run with the same model as before the internet. \nThey're based on centralized authority, credentials, a clear distinction between Writer and Reader, Producer and Consumer -- most of which are really limitations that come out of a few things\n1. The existing limitations of many-to-many communication \nIf you get 50 people together in a room, and you want them all to gain common knowledge - you generally have to have only one person speaking at a time.  Even at human scale - the idea of Broadcast has been sort of a natural pattern.  \n2. Legacy financial structures for creating and distributing intellectual work\nLarge scale broadcast technology started with the printing press - then radio, and TV.  The internet made it incredibly cheap for anyone to become a broadcaster - but the patterns people picked up on it (at least initially) were still pretty broadcast based. \n3. Legacy [[reputation]] and [[fact checking]] systems -- which are both really [[Attention Allocation]] systems.\nIt takes a long time to understand a complicated or counter-intuitive model about how the world works - it takes effort for the reader/listener to understand an author/speaker -- you have to be judicious in who you bother to try to understand.\nWe defer to people who we trust - we cluster reputation into institutions - like the Church, the University, the Newspaper - and as long as we think that institution is doing a good job filtering for us - we listen to it for guidance on who we should bother trying to understand.\nthere is I think a more concise answer here which is that I think...\nTechnology (specifically communications technology) is upstream of culture.  \nEvery major cultural change - and all the major cultural institutions we have (Religion, Science, Politics, Jobs) - emerge from a change in technology that changes the balance of power and makes new options open.\nPrinting press -> Protestant Reformation\nBirth control -> Women's Empowerment\n-> Sexual Revolution\nTV -> JFK's Election, MLK's success\nTwitter -> Trump\nI think we're in a difficult time - where the internet has given us a sense that these old institutions don't really fit and can't REALLY be trusted (you can't really trust the news, science is stagnating / dealing with a reputation crisis - and inaccessible to most, education isn't preparing people for meaningful work, a lot of jobs are bullshit etc.) but at the same time, we don't have the tech available to design new institutions that we CAN trust, because most of our new technology is being built in the shadow of these old institutions. \nIn some ways, we're becoming more powerful as a species- but as a collective - we're becoming STUPIDER - we're less able to form agreements about how the world works and take action on those agreements - we're less able to change our mind as a society as new information comes in.\nThe world is changing faster and faster - but our institutions are becoming more and more fragile and stagnant.\nSo given those [Problems](((bxWvKjPuJ))) and the [Possibility](((wT_EIptMs))) that there was something we could build that could enable more [[Peer to Peer]] institions for [[Collective Intelligence]] and [[Collective Action]] -- I started thinking about designing software for many-to-many communication and collective intelligence.\nWhy Roam though\nWell, I spent about 5 years trying to build technology to fix the news and enable more peer-to-peer government - and what I got to was - the problem was just too big to tackle all at once - there had to be a smaller problem to start with.\nA great starting point for a lot of the [[Problems of Perspective]] would be to just have a single good and well intentioned writer who could take all the material from all the different groups and perspectives - and write a systhesis document - carefully laying out everyone's position - and creating a single digital artifact that tied everything together - but with links back the source material for every statement or claim.  \nI figured that if you could break everything down (but also build bigger things out of the smaller pieces), you could allow individuals to make smaller contributions that could add up to something much more meaningful (though to scale, you'd also need ways to sift through noise and spam and folks gaming the system)\nI started thinking about [[Mortimer Adler]]'s [[Syntopicon]] -- which was an [[Index]] of the \"great ideas of the western world\" -- where they took like 50 books that had shaped western civilization and they combed through all of those books to find the core ideas.  \nThen they wrote an intro for each of the ideas - that talked about how that idea had been addressed by the different authors throughout history - and \n 04:15 - 04:21 \nediting\n04:21 - 04:43 shower\n{{[[TODO]]}} Visit [[Slab City]] [[February 15th, 2020]]\n{{[[DONE]]}} Show off things on the calendar view [[February 11th, 2020]]\n{{[[TODO]]}} Improve the display of paths in [[Mentions]] [[February 12th, 2020]]\n{{[[DONE]]}} User Onboarding Calls [[February 11th, 2020]]\n16:46\n[[User Interview]] with [[Todd Nief]]\ndiscovered through unlinked references that he had done a [[Podcast]] with [[Tiago Forte]]\n((-TfEzmFR-))\n((wdZZTbUB0))\n[[Crossfit]]\n[[Use Cases]] for [[Roam]]\n[[WOD]] -- aka Workout of the Day\n[[February 17th, 2020]]\n2 10min [[AMRaps]]\n21 [[Wallballs]]\n 15 [[Assault Bike Calories]]\n9  [[Box Jumps]]\nhours of sleep:: 6.5\n[[WOD]]\nTook 5g [[Creatine]] and a [[Gatorade]]\n[[WOD/Betty]] \n#[[Exhausted]] \n#[[Feeling/Fresh]]\n[[AMWraps]] 21 minutes\nWallballs:: 21\nAssault Bike Calories:: 15\nBox Jumps:: 9\n((xaFNCqi6I))\n10 minutes on \n5 minute reps\nAs many cycles as you can go\nBench Press:: \n145\n5 reps\n185\n5 reps\n205\n2 sets 5 reps\nLast set needed help on last two\nBest practices for [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]\nOptions\nHave a flow -

The talk was not recorded but you can__Â [watch a (rough) practice talk here](https://www.loom.com/share/936dd606f9d948e194cf39bc353b2816). TheÂ [slides can be found here](https://github.com/stevekrouse/futureofcoding.org/files/3085610/Visual.Denotative.Programming.pdf).\nFor many years I been searching for the perfect paradigm for programming user interfaces. Like many others, I fell in love with FRP with the rise of ReactJS and spent a few years searching for the perfect reactive model. Eventually, I found my way back to the original work on FRP by Conal Elliott. It took me almost a year to make sense of it. This essay attempts to make Conalâs vision more understandable to less mathematically-oriented programmers, and also show how this perspective could be the foundation for a new era of programming, not just with user interfaces, but also multi-node computing, storage, machine learning, etc.\nThis essay assumes familiarity with:\nJavaScript syntax, including Promises,\na web FRP library, such as ReactJS, VueJS, CycleJS, Redux, or Elm,\nand minimal ML/Haskell syntax, including theÂ MaybeÂ type.\nModern Reactive Web Programming[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#modern-reactive-web-programming)\nI fell in love with ReactJS in late 2014. The view is a pure function of state. It was so obviouslyÂ __right__.\nBut of course React isnât the whole answer. Itâs just a view library that keeps the view in sync with state. Itâs left open how you manage that state.\nInspired by the Elm Architecture, Redux became the popular answer to the state management question. It puts the state of the entire application into a single object. To affect this global state object, your HTML event handlers emit âactionsâ, such asÂ {\"type\": \"newTodoItem\", \"description\": \"Clean my room\"}. You then define a reducer function that modifies the global state each time it receives an action. This architecture initially made a lot of sense to me. One big sell is that its global state object is easily serialized, which enables hot reloading and time-travel debugging.\nUnexpectedly, when I tried to make sense of large Redux projects, I found myself getting headaches. I found it difficult to understand how the app fit together, which parts affected which other parts. I began to see that the Redux architecture wasÂ [simulating global mutable state in a seemingly immutable and functional setting, ruining modularity and comprehensibility](https://futureofcoding.org/papers/comprehensible-frp).\nI eagerly slurped up each new React-inspired framework, such as VueJS and CycleJS, to see if they could finally be the âfull solutionâ to interface development, but none felt quite right.\n[Paul Chiusano](https://pchiusano.github.io/)Â suggested I readÂ [Conal Elliott](http://conal.net/), the creator of the FRP paradigm. Paul claimed that React and the other JS-based FRP libraries werenât even âtrueâ FRP. I didnât like to hear this. I loved React and the FRP I knew. I was reluctant to readÂ [a stodgy paper from the 90s](http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/). But I trusted and respected Paul so I gave it a go.\nIt was a lot of mathematics and strange symbols. Whatâs a âleast upper boundâ and âpointed CPOâ? My eyes glazed over. I tried a moreÂ [recent paper he wrote on FRP](http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/), but it was full of scary Applicative Functors and Monads. I gave up.\nHowever, I couldnât escape HN comments alluding to â[real](https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=comment&query=real%20frp)â or â[original](https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=comment&query=original%20frp)â FRP. They were annoying enough to send me back to Conal for another try. This time I printed out all his papers, determined to make sense of them!\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/41498690-cb736744-7141-11e8-98b3-634d0b630f9e.png)\nI took my time with the unfamiliar mathematical and typeclass concepts. With a lot of focused reading, it finally began to click.\nDCTP: Denotative Continuous-Time Programming[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#dctp-denotative-continuous-time-programming)\nItâs important to distinguish between theÂ [many flavors of FRP](https://medium.com/@andrestaltz/why-i-cannot-say-frp-but-i-just-did-d5ffaa23973b). The name originally comes from Conal Elliott and Paul Hudakâs work in the 90s . The term has since been stretch so far beyond its original meaning that Conal hasÂ [retreated to a new phrase](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5385377/the-difference-between-reactive-and-functional-reactive-programming/5386908#5386908)Â to describe his original vision: Denotative Continuous Time Programming (DCTP).\nD is for Denotative[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#d-is-for-denotative)\nThe D of DCTP has similarly nuanced intellectual roots. It stands for âdenotativeâ, a termÂ [Peter Landin proposed](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin66.pdf)Â as a an alternative to ânonproceduralâ, âfunctionalâ or âdeclarativeâ, which lack precise definitions. A denotative programming language is one where:\n(a) each expression has a nesting subexpression structure,\nUnlike most programming languages which have a mix of statement commands and expressions, denotative programming languages live solely in the world of expressions. For example, instead of if-statements, there are ternary expressions. Instead of loops, recursion. Nested mathematical-like expressions are the only way to construct programs, and thus a program is simply one large, nested expression.\n(b) each subexpression denotes something (usually a number, truth value or numerical function),\nAdditionally, the components of denotative languages mustÂ __denote__Â some mathematical object. This was directly inspired by Chris Strachey and Dana Scottâs work from the early 1970âs on denotational semantics, an approach to modeling programming languages with mathematical objects. But where denotational semantics was originally created as a way toÂ __analyze all programming languages__, denotative programming languages are a very specific kind of language, purposefully designed to be well-suited for mathematical reasoning.\nFor example, a map (âobjectâ in JavaScript, âdictionaryâ in Python) in a denotative language couldÂ __denote__Â aÂ __mathematical function__Â of keys toÂ MaybeÂ values. The empty map would beÂ key => Nothing, returningÂ NothingÂ for any key. Inserting a key, value pair could be:Â (map, key, value) => (key' => key === key' ? Just value : map(key)), which wraps an old map function with a new key comparison, but delegates to the old function for the remaining keys.\nThis map need not beÂ __implemented__Â in such an inefficient way for a language to qualify as denotative. Denotations are specifications, describing theÂ __what__, but leaving theÂ __how__Â open. Implementations of denotative languages can be as as non-denotative as efficiency concerns demand. A common misunderstanding of the denotative approach is that itâs impractical to eschew statements, because statements must be executed eventually for computation to be carried out. This is of course true, but the distinction is that in denotative languages, statements live in the implementation of the language instead of in the language itself.\nFor example, even non-denotative languages have functions likeÂ pow,Â sqrt,Â log,Â sin, andÂ cos, which denote their equivalent mathematical operations. Users of these functions are free to treat them as true expressions, without having to worry about their potentially non-denotative implementation details. Do they use specially-designed hardware? Loops? It doesnât matter: users are free to writeÂ log(x) + sin(y)Â and the languageâs compiler or interpreter will execute these expressions with whatever non-denotative algorithm is most efficient, as long as it meets the denotative specification forÂ logÂ andÂ sin.\nFrom the denotative perspective, anywhere an operation does not meet its denotative equivalent is a bug. This would include anywhere floating-point math is used, which causes, for example,Â 0.1 + 0.2Â to equalÂ 0.30000000000000004. In other words, all the quirks of math you need to learnÂ __above and beyond what you already learned in algebra class__Â is considered incidental complexity. On the other hand, non-denotative languages arenât trying to be denotative, so itâs not entirely fair to rank them according to a rubric they are not aiming for.\n(c) the thing an expression denotes, i.e., its âvalueâ, depends only on the values of its subexpressions, not on other properties of them.\nThe final criteria is that expressions in denotative languages are entirely self-contained. Thereâs no action-at-a-distance. Thereâs no way to callÂ someValue.update(). For one, that would be a statement. But additionally, all possible waysÂ someValueÂ updates need to be defined in one of the sub-expressions ofÂ someValueÂ itself.\nIn summary, a denotative language is a pure functional language, with the addition of point (b): mathematical denotations.\nBenefits of Denotative Programming[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#benefits-of-denotative-programming)\nProgrammers spend roughlyÂ [50% of their time reading code](http://www.humane-assessment.com/guide/assessment-costs/), so a language that better lends itself to comprehensibility is a boon for productivity.\nDenotative languages better convey the global structure of a program. We canÂ __fully__Â understand an expression by its subexpressions, and their subexpressions, recursively. There are no spooky action-at-a-distance side-effects that can manipulate things from afar. We donât have to read the entire codebase to ensure we understand a single piece; we must merely read its subexpressions, recursively. This allows us to quickly rule out what we do and do not need to read, saving us a lot of time in large codebases. A denotative language resembles a dictionary or encyclopedia, where one can understand an entry by reading it and what it references. A non-denotative language resembles prose, like a novel, which you have to read cover-to-cover to know what happens, even if you only care about one specific character.\nThese comprehensibility benefits extend to local analysis as well. In denotative programming, the equal sign means what it does in a mathematics textbook: we can replace instances of the left with the expression to the right. This is known as referential transparency. We can safely refactor:\nb **=** f(a)c **=** g(b)d **=** h(c)\nto:\nd **=** h(g(f(a)))\nTrue equality is also a boon for performance optimizations, which is about replacing sections of programs with equivalent but faster sections. When your code is free of operational concerns, the language implementer is able to make more interesting optimizations. The flip-side is that because the denotative approach cuts us off from these implementation details, it lessens the ability of a user of a denotative language to improve the performance of their programs. However, programmer time is often more valuable than CPU time. The Haskell compiler already produces competitive speed and space efficiency for contexts where resources arenât extremely tight, and hopefully this will continue to improve over time due to better chips and advanced compilation techniques.\nFinally, denotative languages offer upgraded support for composibilty and modularity, decreasing the amount of total code required. Conal explains, âModularity comes from providing information while making as few restrictive assumptions as possible about how that information can be used.â For example, âlaziness lets us build infinite data structures, thus not assuming what finite subset any particular usage will access.â The more our code is abstract, general, unspecific, mathematical, and free from operational concerns, the easier it is to use it in other contexts. John HughesâsÂ [Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html)Â beautifully demonstrates how the denotative style, particularly laziness and higher-order functions, enable modularity.\nTwo examples of denotative programming languages are spreadsheets and the denotative subset of Haskell.\nSpreadsheets[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#spreadsheets)\nSpreadsheets are a wonderful sweet spot of power and simplicity, enabling non-programmers to express complex logic. Part of their simplicity lies in their denotative characteristics:\na) There are no statements, only nested expressions.\nb) Each expressions denotes a string, number or truth value.\nc) Thereâs nothing else that can affect the value of a cell except its formula and the formulas of its children, and their children, and their children, and â¦\nThese limitations allow for a global view of a spreadsheet via the âtrace precedentsâ function, which visualizes cell dependencies:\n![](https://officesmart.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/039.jpg)\nHaskell and the IO Monad[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#haskell-and-the-io-monad)\nHaskell is a denotative language, except as it pertains to the IO Monad. Monads are notoriously difficult to understand. I put most of the blame on the IO Monad, which is just one flavor of monad. By themselves, monads arenât so complicated. They are simply a way to sequence computations, taking the result of one and passing it to the next, in order. For example, JavaScript programmers regularly use theÂ PromiseÂ monad without even realizing it as a monad:Â makeHTTPRequest().then(result1 => doSomething(result1)).then(result2 => doSomethingElse(result2)).\nIn Haskell, all monads except the IO Monad have valid denotations. For example, theÂ MaybeÂ monad allows the convenient sequencing of a number of optionally-returning computations, returningÂ JustÂ with the result in the case they all succeed andÂ NothingÂ in the case that any fail.\nHowever, the IO Monad does not denote any mathematical object, but allows forÂ __any__Â non-denotative commands to be generated. For example, it allows for reading and writing to the file system, which violates (b) and (c) properties of denotative languages. Whatâs makes the IO Monad confusing is that itâs allowed in Haskell at all. InÂ [Can functional programming be liberated from the von Neumann paradigm?](http://conal.net/blog/posts/can-functional-programming-be-liberated-from-the-von-neumann-paradigm)Â Conal Elliott laments:\nâmonadic IOâ is a way to generate imperative computations (not just I/O) without having to say anything at all about the semantic content of those computations. Rather than retooling our mental habits completely away from the imperative model of computation, monadic IO is a way to hang onto these old mental habits, and use them in a hybrid functional/imperative programming style, in which the imperative doesnât contaminate the functional, semantically.\nThe IO Monad is particularly confusing because the Haskell community, purported to be the bastion of denotative programming, seems to be content with this non-denotative solution:\nIn a sense, I see us as in a worse position than before. Since the adoption of monadic IO, itâs been less immediately apparent that weâre still enslaved, so thereâs been much less activity in searching for the promised land that the prophet JB [John Backus] foretold. Our current home is not painful enough to goad us onward, as were continuation-based I/O and stream-based I/O. (SeeÂ [A History of Haskell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-history-of-haskell-being-lazy-with-class/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2F~simonpj%2Fpapers%2Fhistory-of-haskell%2F), section 7.1.) Nor does it fully liberate us.\nWhat is the alternative to the IO Monad? How are we to do all the non-denotative operations, such as opening and closing files and sockets, and reading and writing from the console and the database? The alternative is to find clever abstractions that will push these non-denotative operations into the implementation of a fully denotative language. Weâve done it before:\nUnderneath theÂ __implementation__Â of our current functional abstractions (numbers, strings, trees, functions, etc), there are imperative mechanisms, such as memory allocation & deallocation, stack frame modification, and thunk overwriting (to implement laziness). Every one of these mechanisms can be used as evidence against the functional paradigm by someone who hasnât yet realized how the mechanism can be shifted out of the role of a programmingÂ __model__Â notion and into the role ofÂ __implementation__Â of a programming model notion.\nMy favorite example of shifting from the IO Monad to a denotative paradigm is what DCTP did with reactivity.\nDenotative Reactivity[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#denotative-reactivity)\nDenotative languages were naturally best suited to batch calculations with one input and one output, such as compilers. A notorious weak spot was reactive systems that needed to accept and respond to inputs over time, such as robots or user interfaces. For example, a user interface must update itself in response to button clicks and keyboard presses. Before DCTP, these updates were made via some kind of statement. In Haskell it wouldâve been the IO Monad. In JavaScript, we used JQuery for DOM mutations.\nHowever this changed with ReactJS. React allows us to specify UIs as a pure function of state. We can now leave it up to the React library to handle the non-denotative DOM mutations for us. Thatâs not to say that weâve gotten rid of non-denotative computation â they still happen via virtual dom diffing and patching â but weâve shifted those computations down the stack, resulting in a cleaner, high-level denotative computation.\nWhile they were inspired by DCTP, React and other modern FRP libraries violate many denotative principles. For example, most of these libraries allow for mutable state orÂ [simulate it with the Redux / Elm Architecture](https://futureofcoding.org/papers/comprehensible-frp). A very common misconception is confusing DCTP with its implementation details. Conal again:\nEvery time you hear somebody talk about FRP in terms of graphs or propagation or something like that, they are missing the point entirely. Because they are talking about some sort of operational, mechanistic model, not about what it means.\nThe builder of a DCTP framework or libraryÂ __may__Â decided to choose a DAG as an internal data structure, but they may choose an entirely different underlying evaluation strategy. In fact, a DAG is likely the wrong structure for DCTP because DAGs are (definitionally) acyclic, and DCTP often requires cycles to represent the full range of user interfaces.\nThe CT is for Continuous Time[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#the-ct-is-for-continuous-time)\nLetâs continue our study of DCTP with the next two letters. This will also give us the opportunity to further explore the denotative approach, modeling graphics and animations denotatively.\nOne of the inspirations for DCTP came in the form ofÂ [a question from John Reynolds](http://conal.net/blog/posts/early-inspirations-and-new-directions-in-functional-reactive-programming). It roughly amounted to:\nWhat would it be like to program in continuous time?\nThis is a wonderful question, but itâs hard to answer it directly, partly because time is hard to visualize. Letâs come at this via a slightly different question and then circle back to time:\nWhatâs the difference between a bitmap and SVG image?\nContinuous Space[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#continuous-space)\nIn laymanâs terms: if you zoom in a bitmap graphic, it will get all pixelated. But if you zoom into an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), it will remain crystal clear.\n![bitmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/51426691-1f1e0580-1be6-11e9-96ee-1088845d8bfb.jpg)\n__Image Source:Â [StickerYou Blog](https://www.stickeryou.com/blog/post/vector-vs-bitmap)__\nThis is because a circle in a bitmap graphic is just an array of pixels, so if you zoom in, the computer has no choice but to âblow upâ each pixel. However, with a circle in an SVG, the computer always remembers itâs a circle and thus will be able to show it at whatever resolution you want. SVGs are âresolution-independentâ.\nSVGs retain all the relevant info until the very last moment when the computer finally has to put the picture on the screen; then it turns your circle into a bunch of pixels. On the other hand, a bitmap is a bag of pixels always, and thus when you want to zoom in, itâs stuck with too little information (it doesnât know those pixels started out as a circle) to give you what you want. Itâs gone to pixels âtoo early.â\nWhat is a graphic?[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#what-is-a-graphic)\nLetâs get denotative with our definitions. A graphic is function fromÂ xÂ andÂ yÂ coordinates to colors. You give it anÂ (x, y)Â pair; it gives you a color.\nHereâs the difference between bitmaps and SVGs: what kind of numbers make up theÂ (x, y)Â pairs?\nWith bitmaps, itâs a pair of integersÂ (Int, Int) -> Color, while with SVGs itâs a pair of real numbersÂ (Real, Real) -> Color.\nA bitmap is a graphic over discrete space. This means that you can count the pixels one by one. There are no pixels in between two adjacent pixels. This is why we have trouble zooming in: we must create more pixels in between where no pixels yet exist.\nAn SVG is a graphic over continuous space. Between any two points in an SVG there are an INFINITY of points. It wouldnât even make sense to discuss adjacent points, because you could always find more points in between any two points. This is why SVGs scale so well. SVG graphics know the values of infinitely many points, so they are infinitely flexible.\nHereâs a very simple graphic that describes an infinity of points. For all points, the color is red.\n__// Example 1__\n\n**const** red **=** [255, 0, 0, 255]\n\n**const** example1 **=** (x, y) **=>** red\n__[Example 1 GPU Code](https://jsbin.com/pinitox/edit?js,output)__\n__The code for examples 1-5 in this essay reflect the initial JavaScript I wrote, which you can play withÂ [here](https://jsbin.com/pelamug/1/edit?js,output). However, that code was purposefully simple, and thus too slow for graphics larger than 150x150 pixels. It was calculating the color for each pixel on the CPU! Underneath each example, I link to a JSBin with the roughly equivalent (but much uglier) code running on the GPU viaÂ [gpu.js](http://gpu.rocks/). However, the current version of this essay replaces them with equivalent SVGs so as to be easier on your computerâs processor.__\nHereâs another: a green circle with radius 50, centered at (100, 150).\n__// Example 2__\n\n**const** green **=** [0, 255, 0, 255]**const** white **=** [255, 255, 255, 255]\n\n**function** circle(centerX, centerY, r, color) {\n  **return** (x, y) **=>** Math.pow(centerX **-** x, 2) **+** Math.pow(centerY **-** y, 2) **<** Math.pow(r, 2) ? color : white}\n\n**const** example2 **=** circle(100, 150, 50, green)\n[Example 2 GPU Code](https://jsbin.com/hiresut/edit?js,output)\nContinuous Time[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#continuous-time)\nNow letâs return to the original question that inspired FRP:\nWhat would it be like to program in continuous time?\nIn most programming, time is discrete. The ticks of time can be counted one-by-one, and there is no time in between adjacent points. For example, JavaScriptâsÂ requestAnimationFrameÂ has discrete time ticking along at about 60 times per second.\nWhat is an animation?[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#what-is-an-animation)\nAn animation is a graphic that changes over time. That is, it takes anÂ xÂ andÂ yÂ as before, but now it also inputs aÂ tÂ for time, and outputs aÂ ColorÂ as before:Â (x, y, t) -> Color. But again, what kinds of numbers areÂ x,Â yÂ andÂ t? If they are integers, weâre in discrete space and time. Letâs make them all reals, and enter continuous space and time.\nLetâs have our green circle drift off the screen to the right.Â (You may have to refresh the page to see it go.)\n__// Example 3__\n\n**const** example3 **=** (x, y, t) **=>** circle(10*****t, 0, 50, green)(x, y)\n[Example 3 GPU Code](https://jsbin.com/kayakim/edit?js,output)\nLetâs have it go faster.Â (You may have to refresh the page to see it go.)\n__// Example 4__\n\n**const** example4 **=** (x, y, t) **=>** circle(100*****t, 0, 50, green)(x, y)\n[Example 4 GPU Code](https://jsbin.com/hahegon/edit?js,output)\nHow about moving in a circle?Â Letâs use some trig!\n__// Example 5__\n\n**const** example5 **=** (x, y, t) **=>** circle(50*****Math.cos(10*****t), 50*****Math.sin(**-**10*****t), 50, green)(x, y)\n[Example 5 GPU Code](https://jsbin.com/busemas/edit?js,output)\nWhy program with continuous time?[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#why-program-with-continuous-time)\nOf course, for the computer to render animations on the screen, it must at some point convert the continuous time and space to discretized pixels and ticks of time. So whatâs the point of programming in continuous time if it will eventually be discretized?\nThere are aÂ [lot](https://github.com/conal/talk-2014-bayhac-denotational-design#why-continuous-time-matters)Â ofÂ [reasons](http://conal.net/blog/posts/why-program-with-continuous-time). The most compelling argument for me is for the same reason we use SVGs: resolution independence. We want to be able to transform our programs âin time and space with ease and without propagating and amplifying sampling artifacts.â We want to discretize at the last possible moment, and stay as abstract as possible for as long as possible.\nBehaviors and Events[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#behaviors-and-events)\nDCTP extended the denotative approach to handle interactivity, such as mouse and keyboard events. The examples from above were pure functions from x, y and time to color. In DCTP, we call such all such continuous functions from time âBehaviorsâ.\nBehaviors[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#behaviors)\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b8fca9342d56465fc9536efdf8b26e182958a2f/68747470733a2f2f7261776769742e636f6d2f66756e6b69612f686172656163746976652f6d61737465722f666967757265732f6265686176696f722e737667)\n__Graphic of Behaviors from theÂ [Hareactive documentation](https://github.com/funkia/hareactive)__\nBehaviors denote continuous functions of time, such as:\nthe animations above\nthe x-y-position of your mouse\nthe constant functionÂ t -> 1\nthe Boolean valued function:Â t -> t > 10\nEvents[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#events)\nDCTP distinguishes continuous behaviors from discrete event occurrences, such a mouse clicks. Events denote an infinite list of tuplesÂ [(a, Time)], where each tuple contains the event value and the time of its occurrence. Examples include:\nthe click event of your mouse\nkey press event of your keyboard\nan interval of 3 seconds\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bdbe25d1c8cf3490714fcf8d90039be58afcda35/68747470733a2f2f7261776769742e636f6d2f66756e6b69612f686172656163746976652f6d61737465722f666967757265732f73747265616d2e737667)\n__Graphic of Events from theÂ [Hareactive documentation](https://github.com/funkia/hareactive)__\nDCTP & HTML[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#dctp--html)\nUnfortunately, DCTP gets a lot more complicated when we try to extend it to HTML-based user interfaces. While I dream of one-day having a user interface library thatâs denotationally a function from position, time, and hardware events to color, itâs more practical today to output HTML.\nOur first trouble with HTML comes from keeping our functions pure (side-effect free). Letâs say we wanted two buttons side-by-side. It would seem reasonable to do:\nclicks1 **=** button()clicks2 **=** button()\nHowever in a denotative language,Â clicks1Â would have to equalÂ clicks2. Purity requires that callingÂ buttonÂ multiple times canât specify multiple buttons. What we need is a way to explicitly sequence buttons and their click events, such as:\nbutton().then(clicks1 **=>** button()).then(clicks2 **=>** somethingElse)\nTheÂ .then()function (orÂ >=Â in Haskell) for HTML elements accepts a function from the output of the previous element to the next element in the sequence. You may recognize this structure as a monad. This is the approach most DCTP libraries use to construct HTML interfaces, including theÂ [Turbine](https://github.com/funkia/turbine)Â framework used below.\nIt becomes tedious to chain together monads explicitly. In JavaScript, we have theÂ awaitÂ syntactic sugar, but it only works for chaining theÂ PromiseÂ monad. In Haskell, we could use do-notation which works on any monad, but JavaScript doesnât have any generic monadic syntactic sugar. The creators of the Turbine library cleverly co-opt generator functions (function*()) to approximate do-notation for chaining HTML elements. The order of the HTML elements mirror the order in which they areÂ yielded.\nThe final difficulty with the following examples is the quirky way that the Turbine library avoids memory leaks. The Turbine library uses an approachÂ [based on the work of Atze van der Ploeg](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.724.7758&rep=rep1&type=pdf)Â which requires specifying, in a monad, the point in time youâd like the computation to start accumulating state. So below there are two distinct uses ofÂ yield: the first is to add an HTML element to the sequence, and the second is to start accumulating a stateful behavior.\nA Turbine Counter[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#a-turbine-counter)\nCount!0\n**const** counter **=** **function*******() {\n  __// yield a button as the first HTML element in the sequence.__\n  __// It returns an object of all possible event streams on that button.__\n  __// We destructure `clickEvent` as the stream of all click events on the button.__\n  **const** { click: clickEvent } **=** **yield** button(\"Count!\");\n\n  __// Calculate the number of clicks on the button.__\n  __// accumFromComponentCreation is like fold or reduce, but over streams.__\n  __// It is a stateful behavior, so yield here specifies to__\n  __// start accumulating when the component is created on the screen.__\n  **const** clicksCountBehavior **=** **yield** accumFromComponentCreation(\n    (n, m) **=>** m **+** 1,\n    0,\n    clickEvent\n  );\n\n  __// yield a span with the clicks count__\n  **yield** span(clicksCountBehavior);};\n[![Edit Turbine Counter](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/1zkwqvx6qj?module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js)\nA Redux Counter[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#a-redux-counter)\nContrast this approach with a Redux counter. In Turbine, we put everything you need to know aboutÂ clicksCountBehaviorÂ in a single place. HereÂ stateâs definition is spread all over:\nIt is initially set toÂ 0Â in the parameter of the reducer function.\nIt is modified below in reponse to theÂ 'INCREMENT'Â action.\nIt is also modified via the buttonâs onclick event triggering the theÂ 'INCREMENT'Â action.\n**const** counterReducer **=** (state **=** 0, action) **=>** {\n  **switch** (action.type) {\n    **case** 'INCREMENT':\n      **return** state **+** 1;\n    **default**:\n      **return** state;\n  }}\n\n**var** Counter **=** () **=>** (\n  <div className='redux'>\n    <h1>{store.getState()}</h1>\n    <button onClick={()**=>** store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})}>+</button>\n  </div>);\nThe problems of the Redux approach include:\nState is defined in three places as mentioned above: the inital value, itâs mutations in the reducer (which can also be spread out), and the places in the view which trigger the reducer (also spread out)\nState can be modifiedÂ __in terms of any other piece of state__, ruining modularity.\nIt ties this all together withÂ __string-based__Â message types, instead of richer types, like functions or values.\nFrom a comprehensibility perspective, the DCTP/Turbineâs more structured approach is a significant upgrade. However, the higher-order and cyclic flows that are required to make the DCTP approach work offer their own challenges.\nCyclical Flows[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#cyclical-flows)\nUser interfaces often involve cycles, such as in the classic Celsius to Fahrenheit converter application. The app consists of two input boxes, one representing Celsius, and the other Fahrenheit. When either input box is modified, and itâs value is a valid number, the other input box is updated to reflect the corresponding temperature in the other units.\n__// loop allows us to specify cyclic streams____// it takes a function, and passes the output of itself back into itself____// the first run of the function is bootstrapped with placeholder streams__**const** temp **=** loop(\n  ({ c, f }) **=>**\n    **function*******() {\n      __// Add an input box for Celcius__\n      __// Get cVal as the Behavior of the box's value__\n      __// Set the value of the input box to the Behavior c (defined below)__\n      **const** { value: cVal } **=** **yield** input({ value: c });\n      **yield** text(\"Celcius = \");\n      __// Mirros the Celcius input box for Fahrenheit__\n      **const** { value: fVal } **=** **yield** input({ value: f });\n      **yield** text(\"Fahrenheit\");\n\n      __// cValN and fValN are Events of changes to the respective input boxes__\n      __// Parsed as numbers, and filtered for only valid numbers__\n      **const** [cValN, fValN] **=** [cVal, fVal].map(s **=>**\n        changes(s)\n          .map(parseFloat)\n          .filter(n **=>** **!**isNaN(n))\n      );\n      **const** fToC **=** f **=>** (f **-** 32) **/** 1.8;\n      **const** cToF **=** c **=>** (c ***** 9) **/** 5 **+** 32;\n      **const** initialC **=** 0;\n      **const** initialF **=** cToF(initialC);\n\n      __// c_ is the definition of c above__\n      __// stepper converts an event to a Behavior of the last value of the event__\n      __// combines the Celcius input with the Fahrenheit ones, converted to Celcius__\n      **const** c_ **=** **yield** stepperFromComponentCreation(\n        initialC,\n        combine(cValN, fValN.map(fToC))\n      );\n      __// ditto for Fahrenheit__\n      **const** f_ **=** **yield** stepperFromComponentCreation(\n        initialF,\n        combine(fValN, cValN.map(cToF))\n      );\n\n      __// tie the recursive knot__\n      **return** { c: c_, f: f_ };\n    });\n[![Edit Turbine Counter](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/m3640l222j?module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js)\nVisualizing Flows[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#visualizing-flows)\nEven I find the above code hard to read, despite having written it! While this could be seen as a downside of the denotative approach, I see it as a mismatch between the denotative approach and textual syntax.\nThereâs beenÂ [interesting](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/devtool)Â [work](http://rxmarbles.com/)Â [visualizing](https://rxviz.com/)Â [streams](https://rxfiddle.net/), which I hope to build on. Currently, Iâm in the mockup phase, but I hope to build a developer tool experience that will automatically generate a live visualization.\nOne way to visualize these streams is as a dependency tree, annotated with stream values:\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/52425583-9adfe380-2afc-11e9-803c-a3ab4b69f0a4.png)\nIâm also experimenting with a more left-to-right interface with âwormholesâ for far-reaching or cyclic connections:\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D06iuqrW0AABu_g.png)\nUltimately I believe the denotative approach lends itself to a broader range of visualizations than non-denotative approaches. Languages which execute line-by-line, mutating memory addresses are limited to visualizations that look like this:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/54356313-35c76280-4653-11e9-8fdc-96b27806084b.png)\nBecause denotative abstractions are higher level than executing arbitrary instructions, their visualizations can better expose their essence. Instead of stepping through each line and watching what happens to memory, we can visualize a map function as list of initial values beside a list of final values. Even when they model dynamic systems such as in the DCTP examples above, denotative programs have a static structure, which allows us to have a global view of data, like in a spreadsheet or dashboard. We are in the early days of applying visualization techniques to denotative abstractions. Today syntax-based denotative languages like Haskell deservedly have a reputation for abstruseness, but I hope that with live visualizations they will one day be known as the easiest to understand.\nBeyond User Interfaces[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#beyond-user-interfaces)\nWeâve seen how to apply the denotative approach to build user interfaces, but how far can it scale?\nHTTP[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#http)\nHow could we fit HTTP requests into the DCTP model?\nThatâs the wrong question. HTTP requests are too low level. Just like JQuery manually queried and mutated the DOM, HTTP requests manually query and mutate server state.\nThe same is true of all non-denotative APIs, including databases, files, threads, and sockets. All these abstractions are too low-level for the problems every-day programmers need to solve. Their place is in theÂ __implementation__Â of denotative programming systems. The computerâs (or compilerâs) job should be making HTTP requests, reading and writing to files and databases, on your behalf, just like React mutates the DOM on your behalf.\nWe need to liberate ourselves from the antiquated notions of a âfrontendâ and âbackendâ. We need to go higher level and build a denotative model for âwhole systems.â\nDistributed DCTP[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#distributed-dctp)\nThere has been work onÂ [distributed reactivity](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38493-6_16), but not any that truly blurs the line between server-and-client.Â [Even multi-tier languages](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2661140), languages which span an entire client/server app, still require the user to explicitly annotate which code lives on the server and which on the client. To me, such a distinction feels too low-level. I hope to one day have an extended DCTP that can account for the time between computers without referring to other operational details.\nLetâs extend our simple counter button from above to a multi-computer counter button. That is, our counter button will live at a URL, and anyone who loads that URL can contribute to the total clicks count by clicking on the button.\nNotice how nowhere in my description of the counter is any mention of frontends vs backends, databases, or HTTP requests. The essential complexity of this problem has nothing to do with such things, and neither should our code for this problem. Those details would be the compiler or runtimeâs job.\nHereâs a high-level description of what the code could look like: the multi-computer-countÂ __is__Â the count of âall computerâsâ click events, for âall timeâ, where âall computersâ conveys the merging of streams on various computers and âall timeâ conveys the persistent, running total storage of this numberÂ __somewhere__.\nOne important essential complexity detail to keep in mind is that we cannot abstract away the amount of time it takes for information to travel between computers. I find it helpful to imagine interplanetary counter button, where we are counting along with Elonâs Mars colony, 3 light-minutes away.\nMy current favorite strategy to encode this reality into our denotative model is through the lens ofÂ __perception__. Think about creating this counter button from the perspective of one computer. What is the âmulti-computer countâ from the perspective of this computer?\nItâs the count of the merging of two Event streams:\nThe local click event stream from the button on this computer\nThe remote click event stream of all other computers click events\nSo in order to merge local and remote Events steams, we will probably need toÂ liftÂ the local Event stream into a remote one. Then weÂ merge. Then weÂ count. Now we have a remoteÂ Behavior, which we can (maybe through some other type munging) put on the screen.\nML != neural networks[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#ml--neural-networks)\nHereâs one final example of how the denotative approach could affect another area of programming: machine learning.\nIn a recent call I had with Conal, he criticized the mainstream perspective on ML. For example, the Tensorflow API is all about graph construction, but thatâs just an implementation detail. A neural network is one possible optimization technique, but if you expose that API users, youâre locking them into a lower-level abstraction than their problem requires.\nMachine learning about optimizing functions on a large amount of data. Conal is currently building a denotative ML API that he thinks will not only be more elegant to program with, but be more performant as well. This work builds upon ConalâsÂ [denotative approach for calculating derivatives](http://conal.net/papers/essence-of-ad/).\nConclusion[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#conclusion)\nIn the tradition of DijkstraâsÂ __Goto Considered Harmful__, denotative programming promises us higher-quality code with the replacement of various language features, such as statements and mutable state, with a cleaner alternatives, such as recursion and streams. In this way, the denotative approach is a ideal to strive for, not a panacea to solve all problems.\nNewfound computational capabilities will likely always be initially expressed non-denotatively, and early adopters of such technologies will be eager to use whatever API necessary for their desired outcome. Whatâs possible at the edge of computing will always outrun the denotative. Eventually the denotative will catch up to whatâs possible today, but by then new technologies will have outpaced our denotative APIs. This one of the cost of the denotative approach: the wait for it to be practical.\nIn exchange for our patience, we get elegance and simplicity. The denotative confines of the spreadsheet has enabled tens of millions of non-programmers to model complex numerical systems. Denotative programming, extended to handle time-varying values, events, and distributed computing, has the promise to similarly democratize all other aspects of computation, such as user interfaces, web and mobile applications, robotics, and machine learning.\nThe denotative community can be viewed as a small subset of the functional programming community. Itâs mathematical roots scares off potential supporters. Efforts to democratize the denotative approach, such as this essay and flow visualizations, help gain this movement supporters. The more people who see the value in this approach, the more effort will be put behind bringing denotative interfaces to modern technologies, and the sooner the denotative approach can be applied to a computational problem near you.\nFurther resources[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#further-resources)\n[Letâs reinvent FRP](http://vindum.io/blog/lets-reinvent-frp/)Â by Simon Friis Vindum\nConal answers âWhat is FRP?â on Stack OverflowÂ [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5878525)Â andÂ [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028250/what-is-functional-reactive-programming/1030631#1030631)\n[Explicitly Comprehensible Functional Reactive Programming](https://futureofcoding.org/papers/comprehensible-frp)Â by [[Steve Krouse]]\n[The Essence and Origins of FRP](https://github.com/conal/talk-2015-essence-and-origins-of-frp)\n[Functional Reactive Animation](http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/)Â - the original FRP paper by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak\n[Whatâs Functional Programming All About?](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html)\n[The introduction to Reactive Programming youâve been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)Â by Andre Staltz\n[Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html)Â by John Hughes\nAcknowledgements[](https://futureofcoding.org/essays/dctp#acknowledgements)\nThanks to Jonathan Edwards for his support and advice.

Boundaries arise at all scales, defining the entities that they surround and protecting them from some kinds of outside intrusion. To be functional, boundaries must be permeable, allowing the entities to take energy and information from outside themselves. If we are looking at complex systems, we will find boundaries everywhere.\nBoundaries are structures that protect what is within them and allow their contents to solve smaller, more manageable design problems than would be possible in a perfectly interconnected system.\nIslands are surrounded by natural boundaries. Strange varieties of life arise on islands that are not seen anywhere else, precisely because they are cut off from the densely interconnected systems present in the ocean and on large land masses. Islands, small systems surrounded by a natural ocean boundary, give life the opportunity to try amazing stunts that would be impossible on a large landmass. Drifting daisies evolve into trees; drifting iguanas learn to swim; fruit flies evolve into fantastic, showy varieties; crabs grow a meter long and figure out how to open coconuts. Tree kangaroos, ground parrots, and giant tree skinks are niches only available on islands. And when the boundary opens (often because of that great destroyer of natural boundaries, humans), the unique species on islands are often out-competed by species that evolved in the diversity-flattening zones of great land masses. Boundaries drive diversity.\nNote that the moon, however, despite being separated from the continents of Earth by a significant boundary, is not teeming with unusual life. This boundary is too great, too harsh, and not permeableÂ __enough__Â to allow life to adapt to it in the first place.\nLife itself has discovered a number of effective boundaries that allow it to diversify and flourish. The cell membrane is the most basic boundary. Trivially, there are no multicellular creatures without cell membranes; less trivially, there are no complex creatures whatsoever without this protecting, organizing, problem-space-limiting innovation. And in evolving a cell membrane, the most important problem to solve was how to get things through it: how to make it permeable enough to be useful.\nThe diversity explosion of the Cambrian era was aided by the discovery of a different kind of boundary: the exoskeleton. Exoskeletons provided a boundary protecting individual trilobites, which differentiated into many different forms and niches. Cell walls,Â [evolving independently in multiple taxa](http://public.wsu.edu/~lange-m/Documnets/Teaching2011/Popper2011.pdf), protect and shape the forms of plants.\nAnother kind of boundary that limits the space of problem solving and promotes diversity is Pattern 13 of Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray SilversteinâsÂ [__A Pattern Language__](http://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/set.htm): theÂ [Subcultural Boundary](http://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl013.htm)Â that occurs between neighborhoods in cities:\nThe mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity, next door to one another. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their neighbors, if they are physically separated by physical boundaries.\nDistinct neighborhoods and distinct ways of life can only evolve within permeable boundaries of some kind, so that they can have communication with the outside world, but not be simply absorbed, flattened, and made uniform by forces outside them.\nWhen natural boundaries between human groups are lacking, there has beenÂ [intense pressure in human history](http://thesciencenetwork.org/docs/BB3/Turchin_AgrarianEmpires.pdf)Â to create effective boundaries of other kinds; military arms races across poorly-defined boundaries may be seen as building a new kind of boundary. This is one interpretation of âgood fences make good neighbors;â only good boundaries are capable of organizing people well. (It is important that G. K. Chesterton chooses fences for hisÂ [famous analogy](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/833466-in-the-matter-of-reforming-things-as-distinct-from-deforming)Â about reformers.)Â If we think of agency as â[the ability to take action](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/11/27/patterns-of-refactored-agency/),â boundaries are essential for an entity to have any kind of agency.\nIn the present essay I am mostly interested in boundaries around groups much smaller than a nation state. I suggest that these small group entities â overlapping entities of multiple sizes, from Dunbar-sized âtribesâ to neighborhoods of 7,000 or so â have increasingly had their boundaries undermined, and have largely ceased to exist and function. I suggest that ritual, my subject for the past two posts in this series, both functions to draw boundaries and to energize and coordinate human groups within the boundary so defined. I suggest that the loss of these small groups, in favor of nation-level organization of atomized individuals, has had serious consequences for human welfare and human agency. We are missing a layer of organization essential for our happiness.\n**Individual Imagination, Groups, and Flourishing**\nPerhaps the most important question of our time is how human beings can flourish and enjoy satisfying, meaningful lives under conditions of material abundance and extreme cultural interconnectedness. InÂ [A Dent in the Universe](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/02/18/a-dent-in-the-universe/), Venkat proposes that âimaginationâ is a crucial survival skill at higher levels of Maslowâs hierarchy. Here, I propose that individual âimaginationâ â even at its best â is woefully underpowered to solve problems of human flourishing by itself.\nThe lower levels of Maslowâs pyramid reflect material well-being. But material abundance is notÂ __itself__Â the cause of anomie and angst. Rather, ancestral, evolved solutions to lower-level problems also tended to contain solutions to higher-level problems as well. As these ancestral solutions are made obsolete by solutions that are more efficient on the material level, the more ineffable, higher-level problems they solved present themselves anew. Simple abundance of food is not the cause of obesity, but rather the loss of carefully evolved ancestral diets. Our ancestors found it easy to get to sleep because they were tired from intense physical activity; we often find it a challenge to get to sleep because modern solutions to material problems do not include physical activity. We are lonely and bored not because of material abundance simpliciter, but because the specific cultural patterns that have reproduced themselves to produce material abundance have whittled away the social and psychological solutions that were built into old solutions to material problems.\n[![Some challenges encountered at supposedly high levels of Maslow's hierarchy](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image.jpg)](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image.jpg)\nSome challenges encountered at supposedly high levels of Maslowâs hierarchy\nHere, I hope to motivate a humility toward carefully evolved ancestral patterns, and, especially, to theÂ __conditions and forces that allowed such patterns to evolve__Â in the first place. The old patterns, exactly as they existed in the past, simply will not work to solve modern problems. But new, effective patterns do not come in a âflash of insightâ to individuals; individuals have relatively little agency and power in shaping the way things are. Individual imagination is weak; evolution is strong.\n**Boundaries as Constraints on Design Complexity**\nEvolution, like human designers, faces constraints. Design problems that are too large, complex, and densely interconnected are unlikely to be solved by either process. Christopher Alexander opens his 1964 bookÂ __Notes on the Synthesis of Form__Â with a quotation from PlatoâsÂ __Phaedrus__:\nFirst, the taking in of scattered particulars under one Idea, so that everyone understands what is being talked about . . . Second, the separation of the Idea into parts, by dividing it at the joints, as nature directs, not breaking any limb in half as a bad carver might.\nWhat does it mean to carve reality at the joints? Alexander provides an explication with an analogy to a hypothetical design problem. He introduces the concept ofÂ [âfitâ](http://carcinisation.com/2014/08/11/beauty-is-fit/), the absence of misfit, which is to say, a design that solves its problem. âFitâ is a song that is beautiful, a chair that is comfortable, a kettle that is not too heavy or expensive and that heats water quickly. âMisfitâ is ugliness, discomfort, uselessness, or other failures to solve design problems.\nNow imagine an abstraction, a grid of one hundred lightbulbs connected to each other, ten by ten, representing a design problem with many variables. If a light is on, it corresponds to misfit; if a light is off, it corresponds to fit. Each light (variable) is connected to some number of other variables, just as, for instance, the variable of teakettle material is connected to expense and to its capacity to heat quickly.\nIf all variables are uniformly connected to all other variables, the system has little chance of reaching an equilibrium of âfitâ by trial and error; the problem is too complex. However, if there are zones of dense interconnectivity that are not densely connected to each other, then reality may indeed be capable of being âcarved at the joints,â and less difficult design problems exist that have a chance of being solved independently of each other, whether by evolution or by human agency:\n[![An interpretation of Alexander's design space metaphor](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image1.jpg)](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image1.jpg)\nAn interpretation of Alexanderâs design space metaphor\nThe existence of these zones of dense interconnectedness, that are not densely interconnected to each other, is a prerequisite for solvability. They are surrounded by a kind ofÂ __permeable boundary__, as pictured. This is analogous toÂ [âinformation hidingâ](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding)Â in object-oriented programming; just as a living cell controls what enters it and acts on it, an electronic âobjectâ limits access to its internal processes, accepting and returning only certain types of information. More ominously, a âblack boxâ with limited interaction that solves a problem effectively is often so useful that it backfires: it becomes a new, required âsolutionâ that limits the space of future design, often ironically resulting in poor fit. (More on this in the later section entitled âTiling Structures and Monstrosities.â)\nAnother relevant analogy is the concept ofÂ [life and death](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_death)Â in the game of Go. The game of Go is a game of drawing boundaries. Within aÂ __boundary__Â of stones, a structure is âaliveâ if any action on it can be met with a reply that preserves it, even when surrounded by enemy stones.\nA kind of programming is occurring here, a complex tree of if-then statements abstracted into shape. Only a bounded structure can âlive,â but within its bounds, it cannot be vulnerable to dangerous inputs. A perfectly impermeable boundary â a solid group of stones, with no holes or âeyesâ â is dead, captured when the opponent encircles it. But a structure with enough âeyesâ (holes where enemy stones may be placed) lives, and is held as territory.\nTo summarize, boundaries function to protect their contents from harmful intrusion, to allow for the solution of smaller design problems, and to preserve and encourage diversity. On the other hand, solutions developed at small scales are of limited utility if they cannot be adapted for use on larger scales. There must be communication and connection in order for bounded entities to live. Perfectly impermeable boundaries result in stasis and death, in social and biological life as in the game of Go.\nNetworks allow bounded entities to communicate and coordinate, and allow solutions developed at small scales to be used more widely. However, densely interconnected systems carry inherent risks not seen on the lower levels of organization. As we have seen, good design solutions cannot emerge from systems that are too densely interconnected. Beyond that, complex networks are vulnerable to (often inscrutable) risk of large-scale collapse. And black box âsolutionsâ often seem to reproduce themselves like a plague, limiting design space and preventing new refactorings. The next section introduces some analogies to help think about networks and the balance between boundaries and interconnectedness.\n**Networks and Complex Interconnected Systems**\nOn May 30, 2002, three ice climbers died in a fall on Mt. Hood. The incident, described in Laurence Gonzalesâ excellentÂ __[Deep Survival](https://books.google.com/books?id=IYqfaA4MWSIC&printsec=frontcover)__Â (Chapters 6 and 7), involved several of the most common factors in mountaineering accidents: the climbers were roped together, without fixed protection. That means that they did not anchor themselves to the ice, but attached themselves to each other, so that if one fell, all fell. They chose to form a tightly-coupled system (via the rope), without anchoring that system physically to the ice they clung to. âWhen a system is tightly coupled,â Gonzales says, âthe effects spread. When a system is loosely coupled, effects do not spread to other parts of the system.â Like falling dominos, the mistake of one ice climber spreads to the others he is roped to â especially in the absence of adequate protection. The hope of one or more climbers executing a âself-arrestâ â stabbing an ice axe into the ice before it is too late â is hampered by the fact that the force of a free-falling human (or two) is enough to dislocate the shoulders of a human strong enough to hold onto his axe.\nThere are two important points to this analogy. First, in tightly-coupled (densely interconnected) complex systems, one entity can send force into the system that destabilizes the entire structure. Second, humans are not good at noticing the dangers inherent in such systems. The type of accident reported in Gonzalesâ 2003 book continues to occur withÂ [clockwork](http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2009/06/roped-together-climbers-die-fall-mount-mckinley-denali-national-park-and-preserve)Â [regularity](http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/local/regional/2014/06/27/11532989/). Gonzales quotes a climber who characterizes climbing roped together without fixed protection as âa suicide pactâ â but climbers are apparently not good at noticing when they have entered such an unreasonable pact.\nThere are many problems with this analogy. In the case of climbers roped together without fixed protection, all the risk comes from individual accident or mistake. In reality, the risks inherent in complex systems often come from the system itself â though individual inputs are often dangerously propagated as well, as with parasite infestation in agriculture.\nAnother problem with the climbing analogy is that, in complex systems, there are many levels of âfallingâ other than death. Certainly, the extremely interconnected system humans have built risks complete collapse and extinction. But being âroped togetherâ in a sufficiently interconnected system may also mean that we become stuck at low levels of well-being, unable to evolve better solutions at small scales to problems not quite as dire as death and extinction. Consider healthcare and education systems that require all citizens to participate in them and prevent smaller, better solutions from evolving. Obesity, boredom, and loneliness may not be quite as bad as death, but are levels of âfallingâ that sufficiently connected and tightly-coupled systems impose on their member human beings, limiting their freedom to attempt smaller-scale solutions.\nConsider this substitute analogy, for contrast: instead of being suspended on ice, the people are suspended in air on a commercial airplane. Here, people are not roped together, but entirely dependent on a complex system, any aspect of which may fail.\nWho âchoosesâ when to become part of a complex system, and which of its components to accept or reject? Where is the agency located? Often, poorly-fitting pieces of complex systems seem to be thrust upon us without our consent, with no practical way to refuse it. Network effects can frustrate human agency instead of magnifying it; I call these âtiling structures.â\n**Tiling Structures and Monstrosities**\nI use the personal jargon âtiling structureâ or âtiling systemâ to describe a system that causes itself to be replicated, tiling the world with copies of itself. Some tiling structures are biological; humans are a tiling structure, tiling all continents with copies of the same kind of naked primate. Some are technological; agriculture tiled the world with itself not by making humans healthier, taller, or less prone to famine, but by producing sheer numbers and densities of miserable people for thousands of years so effectively (despite all the famines) that other options for subsistence were tiled out of existence.\nTiling structures are one explanation for why urban design looks so uniform (and so soul-crushingly ugly) throughout the United States. Certain forms are ubiquitous because they solve certain delineated problems effectively enough to become effectively mandatory: power lines, big box retail, strip malls, freeways, parking lots, and billboards are such powerful patterns that few locales can refuse them, despite their ugliness and the constraints they impose. Education has tiled the world with itself; it is taken for granted that children are to be locked up in adult-controlled cages for most of the day. Together with the other tiling systems, education has obliteratedÂ [unique childrenâs cultures](http://carcinisation.com/2014/10/04/the-last-of-the-monsters-with-iron-teeth/). The democratic government that requires this kind of education (what I call the âfree child caging service,â although it is certainly not free) may be regarded as a tiling structure: it tends toward more control and intrusion into the boundaries of smaller entities, constraining what they can do.\nSome tiling structures are âtop down,â like government education: imposed on sub-entities against their will. Others are âbottom upâ â a design problem is solved in such a way that all later actors adopt it, and it gradually becomes just as mandatory and constraining as a top-down imposed pattern. The blogger Viznut examines this latter dynamic with respect to software development; instead of attempting to solve problems by refactoring from scratch and âcutting reality at the joints,â pre-existing chunks are adopted and glued together to form a monstrosity that just barely works and is riddled with misfit:\nTell a bunch of average software developers to design a sailship. They will do a web search for available modules. They will pick a wind power module and an electric engine module, which will be attached to some kind of a floating module. When someone mentions aero- or hydrodynamics, the group will respond by saying that elementary physics is a far too specialized area, and it is cheaper and more straight-forward to just combine pre-existing modules and pray that the combination will work sufficiently well.\nViznut,Â [The Resource Leak Bug of Our Civilization](http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-resource-leak-bug-of-our.html)\nWhether or not this is a fair description of software developers, I think it is an accurate description of how people build their lives. We select from the available chunks and try to fit them together into a coherent whole â an education here, a job there, a box to live in, entertainment to pass the time. These available âlife partsâ tend to be black boxes in whose design we have little say. They may not fit together into a satisfying whole at all â the boat they make may not float. Perfectly adequate material solutions fail to provide essential ânutrientsâ â sometimes literally (as with obesity), sometimes figuratively (sunshine, eye contact, exercise). It is tempting to accuse a person who cannot make a coherent life out of the available parts of having too little imagination; however, I do not think this kind of problem is one that individual imagination is powerful enough to solve. Even the most imaginative among us will tend to build a âmonstrosityâ instead of a life.\nWe may ask a very practical question: where lies the agency that accepts or rejects certain âblack boxâ structures or tiling systems? An important myth of our time is thatÂ __voting__Â is an effective way for individuals to have agency in a democracy. The idea that the aggregate will of millions of people is adequately expressed by voting in elections is a rather outlandish claim, and clearly one with much evidence against it, but the âplausibility structureâ of democracy causes us to believe this fiction on faith.\n[![Why democracy seems to work](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image2.jpg)](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image2.jpg)\nWhy democracy seems to work\nOneÂ __pathological boundary__Â that has been imposed top-down by our democratic system is drug prohibition. Total prohibition, in the form of the drug war, drew a boundary that created a very lucrative niche that only the most ruthless, violent actors could fill. The drug war prevented small-scale, non-totalitarian solutions to drug problems from ever being attempted, including the kind ofÂ [small group rituals](http://www.npr.org/2013/04/25/177315132/controversy-brews-over-churchs-hallucinogenic-tea-ritual)Â that allow people to use drugs in healthy, prosocial ways. The drug war hampers small group agency even more than individual agency; individuals may use drugs underground, supplied by those violent niche-fillers, in isolation or among the dispossessed, but if groups attempt to use drugs in healthy ways, a raid is almost guaranteed. âPrescription power,â limiting the power to prescribe drugs to doctors, is part of the drug war; I do not hold much hope forÂ [medicalized drug rituals](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment)Â administered by doctors. Despite wide agreement that the drug war is a failure, humans do not seem to have the agency to end it.\nThe idea that individual âconsumersâ express their will effectively by choosing among the options provided in the market is a myth that is related to democratic agency through voting. There is agency in market choice, but it is limited to the options provided, which are in turn limited by what other people are willing to buy. Much of what humans want and need isÂ [not possible to supply in markets](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/markets-in-almost-nothing.html), and the chunks that are supplied are often not good materials for composing a human life. I think that only small human groups are capable of supplying these benefits that are difficult for the market to capture. Both producers and government find it easiest to tile the world when humans are atomized into individuals, rather than in small groups with appropriate, permeable boundaries; but a nation of individuals makes it difficult for anyone to experience belonging. Only a small group, and not âthe nationâ or, even worse, âMankind,â can supply social belonging and even multiply agency. A small group has its own agency, in the sense that a group of 200 or 7,000 is capable of more, when coordinated together with boundaries, than the same number of individuals operating completely independently. (This is why the ideal firm size is not one; transaction costs turn out to be significant.) Firms are efficient at producing material goods and services for the market, but they are not good at providing belonging and happiness for people.\nThese small-group levels of organization are increasingly missing. Church membership decreases, and no new cults spring up to take their place. Work, education, legal, and residential design patterns make it difficult for local groups to form and express themselves. Rituals increasingly tend toward the spectacle rather than small group participation. And without rituals to set their boundaries and energize them, small groups cannot thrive.\n**Boundaries, Agency, and Beauty**\nA story I have heard about theÂ [Langley Schools Music Project](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langley_Schools_Music_Project)Â is that one of the music teacherâs strategies was to supply the children with instruments that were tuned such that they could not make âoffâ notes; rather than overwhelm children with a piano full of notes, they were given gamelan or other instruments that only made harmonious notes. The children could immediately pick them up and make music, rather than having to wade through years of inharmonious noise. âToy instrumentsâ (theÂ [thumb piano](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira)Â is a beautiful and very functional example) reduce the problem solving space: there are fewer options, but they all sound good and can be combined together to make music that exhibits âfit.â\nMaynard Owen Williams, writing inÂ __National Geographic__Â in 1921, writes about what happens to folk aesthetics when unfamiliar elements are introduced:\nIn Merv I saw the havoc modern commerce has wrought with lovely Oriental rugs. The same thing is taking place in the peasant costumes of Czechoslovakia, with the same aniline dyes being substituted for vegetable colors, which were not only much softer when new, but which fade into mellow tones no chemical dye can duplicate.\nFactories are calling the women from the farms, where they utilized the winter months in working out the designs traced by the village designer or in evolving their own. Thus, gradually the arts of the past are being lost.\nGood solutions to design problems â beauty in all its forms âÂ __evolve__Â into being as least as much as it they are created by individual human agency. The solution to design problems in the human realm have had a long time to evolve in ancestral cultures, in which they evolved under more bounded, less interconnected conditions than we experience today. When new variables are added, the old aesthetic cannot instantly absorb them, but must work through many iterations of misfit before good fit is discovered. Individual humans continue to change, elaborate, and shape their aesthetics, but the more elements (choices) are added to the problem space, the smaller the chance of hitting on a good solution.\nChristopher Alexander seizes on the same example as Williams in a bit more detail in his 1964 bookÂ __Notes on the Synthesis of Form__Â to elucidate a model of cultural evolution, which I quote at length:\nThe Slovakian peasants used to be famous for the shawls they made. These shawls were wonderfully colored and patterned, woven of yarns which had been dipped in homemade dyes. Early in the twentieth century aniline dyes were made available to them. And at once the glory of the shawls was spoiled; they were now no longer delicate and subtle, but crude. This change cannot have come about because the new dyes were somehow inferior. They were as brilliant, and the variety of colors was much greater than fefore. Yet somehow the new shawls turned out vulgar and uninteresting.\nNow if, as it is so pleasant to suppose, the shawlmakers had had some innate artistry, had been so gifted that they were simply âableâ to make beautiful shawls, it would be almost impossible to explain their later clumsiness. But if we look at the situation differently, it is very easy to explain. The shawlmakers were simply able, as many of us are, to recognizeÂ __bad__Â shawls, and their own mistakes.\nOver the generations, the shawls had doubtless often been made extremely badly. But whenever a bad one was made, it was recognized as such, and therefore not repeated. And though nothing is to say that the change made would be for the better, it would still be a change. When the results of such changes were still bad, further changes would be made. The changes would go on until the shawls were good. And only at this point would the incentive to go on changing the patterns disappear.\nSo we do not need to pretend that these craftsman had special ability. They made beautiful shawls by standing in a long tradition, and by making minor changes whenever something seemed to need improvement. But once presented with more complicated choices, their apparent mastery and judgement disappeared. Faced with the complex unfamiliar task of actually inventing such forms from scratch, they were unsuccessful.\nIt is frequently observed that constraints and obstructions are precisely where great art comes from; far from limiting art, they allow it to happen and feed it â the more demanding the constraints, the better. This paradoxical relationship between constraint and expression is the subject of the movieÂ __The Five Obstructions__Â (which I highly recommend). An aesthetic is one form of a constraint, and aesthetics tend to be developed, elaborated, and enjoyed in small groups. Certain aspects of reality are excluded in order to focus on the ones within the aesthetic. An aesthetic also provides a context in which forms can exist, fit, and be beautiful (or fail to be).\nThe work of elaborating an aesthetic together, as a small group, providing context for each otherâsÂ [selves](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/01/08/ritual-and-the-consciousness-monoculture/), is some of the fundamental work of being human, a way for humans to be valuable to each other that markets cannot supply.\nIt is perhaps aÂ [hipster](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/11/fungibility-and-loss-of-demandingness.html)Â universal, and one I share, to declare that modern fashion is ugly compared to almost every âfolk costumeâ ever devised. Clothing is cheaper and more plentiful than it has ever been in human history, and yet we all look terrible. The âchunksâ that individuals may select from the market are difficult to fit together into a coherent aesthetic; most retreat into a nondescript uniform (jeans, printed t-shirts, hoodies) that is more of an apology for existing than an outfit. If people are not good at solving even so simple a problem asÂ __fashion__, with the help of all those factories, how are they supposed to design excellent lives for themselves? I am not blaming anyone for bad fashion here; I am remarking that we are all deprived of a possible source of beauty and enjoyment by the lack of coherent community aesthetics. We are deprived of both context and excuse for beauty, and individuals are seldom up to the effort and social risk. It is not a problem we are well-designed to solve individually, for it is not an individual problem at all, but one of groups.\nThe more that economically efficient tiling systems intrusively organize us and our environments, the more beauty is crowded out and eradicated. There is a tendency to imagine that the world is fair and that there must be a trade-off â longer lives and more clothes in exchange for less beauty, perhaps. But it is not clear what entityâs agency is authorizing such a trade. Ugliness is an easy externality to impose because it is difficult for individuals to coordinate against.\nConsider the leaf blower. Millions of people are subjected to loud, unpleasant noise every day so that the removal of leaves from certain areas may be performed more efficiently; this is possible because there is no mechanism for the suffering of those affected by blasts of noise to be internalized by the actors who benefit by making it a bit cheaper to blow leaves around. Are we better off because gas-powered leaf blowers exist? I submit that we are much worse off, and we have been âtiledâ by the leaf blower tiling structure because there was no coherent agency to refuse this intrusion. Individuals do not have much power to stop the noise; small groups are sometimes successful in excluding them from their environment, but the continued prevalence of leaf blowers indicates the absence of widespread, powerful small-group agency capable of protecting its membersâ aesthetic interests.\nNoise pollution is rampant and very damaging, but a more subtle form of pollution, equally unremedied, is legible word pollution. Here is Johan Christian Dahlâs 1839 paintingÂ [__View of Dresden by Moonlight__](http://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Johan_Christian_Dahl_-_View_of_Dresden_by_Moonlight_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg):\n[![Johan Christian Dahl, View of Dresden by Moonlight (1839)](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image3.jpg)](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image3.jpg)\nJohan Christian Dahl,Â __View of Dresden by Moonlight__Â (1839)\nNow, here is the same painting given a modern update with word pollution:\n[![Word pollution](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image4.jpg)](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image4.jpg)\nWord pollution\nWords are processed differently than non-words, and literate people are forced to process words if they are in their visual field. Words on top of beautiful things ruin their beauty. But beauty is a difficult interest to protect in our world, and ugliness externalities flourish. The advertising tiling structure fills the landscape with signs and billboards that create more ugliness than value in the aggregate, but whose damage cannot be recouped on the market. Increasingly, fashion itself is tiled with words and legible symbols â words express social meanings more cheaply and legibly than clothing without words. The result is that everyoneâs eyes are constantly being assaulted with unwanted meanings that ruin visual fields that might otherwise be beautiful.\nIndividuals alone can only retreat from all the noise and ugliness into a walled, private world (if theyâre lucky, and tolerate loneliness well). The most sensitive people are the worst off, and of course people vary in sensitivity. Small groups of humans, however, might provide real respite from the tiling structures of the world. The next section considers these entities that have become semi-mythical, described in nostalgic, archaic words like âtribe,â âneighborhood,â or âcommunityâ: small groups of humans.\n**Small Groups of Humans**\nSmall groups, and not masses of disconnected individuals, are the contexts in which most ancestral solutions to human design problems evolved. There is much romanticism these days for âtribes,â a form of organization that has not been economically effective for many centuries. We still instinctively long for this kind of belonging, as our sacrifices to sports teams, fraternities, or churches demonstrate.\nVernor Vingeâs novelÂ __A Fire Upon the Deep__Â portrays an alien species of dog-like animals, with each conscious individual made up of multiple animals, forming a group self. In military combat, after most members of a pack are killed, singleton âfragmentsâ wander the countryside, asking other packs, âWhere am I? May I be part of youâ¦please?â\nI find this depiction to be a poignant analogy for our present state as humans â except that the small group entities mostly do not exist for us to join. They have been tiled out of existence, merged into a mass of individuals who can no longer supply each other what they need. We donât really know how to make tribes.\nPattern 12 ofÂ __A Pattern Language__, Community of 7,000, declares that âindividuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5,000-10,000 persons.â This is the neighborhood layer of small groups. Small groups ideally (and traditionally) exist in multiple overlapping layers,Â [mirroring the nature of the human self](http://carcinisation.com/2014/08/29/two-patterns/).\nInternet communities are becoming more valuable as sources of belonging and meaning, but their geographic boundlessness is a limitation as well as a benefit. Only local groups can protect their membersâ interests in local physical space; quiet internet communities of intense connoisseurship cannot protect us from noise or ugliness in the meat world. Internet communities have less power than local communities to give us eye contact, sunshine, and exercise, or even to allow us to wear beautiful clothing in public. While I have much hope for the internet as a ritual domain, the groups that will be most powerful in solving the problems set out at the beginning of this essay will be local, on-the-ground, âcolocatedâ groups.\nIt is difficult to say how to bring these groups into existence, but I think that doing rituals together is an unavoidable component. Rituals function as permeable boundaries, network people together, smooth conflict, provide beneficial mental states, and allow the group to practice the expression of its agency as a corporate entity. Whether the rituals exist for the benefit of the group, or the group exists as an excuse to do the rituals, is a matter of perspective.\nShare this:\n[Twitter](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/?share=twitter&nb=1)\n[Facebook](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/?share=facebook&nb=1)\n[Pocket](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/?share=pocket&nb=1)\n[Email](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/?share=email&nb=1)\n[Print](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#print)\n[LinkedIn](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/?share=linkedin&nb=1)\nGet Ribbonfarm in your inbox\nGet new post updates by email\nE-Mail Address\nNew post updates are sent out once a week\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c6f5d3dae3ca2ba8c6317c184cc9b693?s=70&d=blank&r=g)**About Sarah Perry**\nSarah Perry is a ribbonfarm contributing editor and the author ofÂ [__Every Cradle is a Grave__](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989697290/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0989697290&linkCode=as2&tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&linkId=UF6UA7ZHX7J5MLVI).

This is a rich vein, and even though I am much more interested in developing the individualism angle on these themes, the collective angle is of course key context.\nSome angles that immediately occur to me include:\n1. Stuart Kauffman in his Santa Fe work (Hidden Order I think is the one) describes computational biology experiments that explore the transition from single-to-multicellular in terms of the âchemical soupâ going from supercritical to subcritical, and the division process serving to keep the soup containerized in edge-of-supercritical chunks: neither explosive, nor net dissipative. Right amount of cellularization, so to speak, to keep the entity coherent as a dissipative structure.\n2. Another angle which I am kinda surprised you didnât touch upon since youâre coming from urbanism, is densification of cities/neo-urbanism. From Jane Jacobs in the 60s to Geoffrey West (also Santa Fe), the idea that larger, more densely packed populations are âbetterâ in a certain sense is a big theme. Westâs recent work shows that in lots of material terms, from energy efficiency to innovation, big cities are way better than small communities. They show superlinear growth, which seems exactly analogous to supercritical chemical soups, and also analogous to gaseous masses being large enough to go nuclear and turn into stars, rather than staying gas giant planets. Not sure how this plays into your angle, but I think the interesting phenomenon is modern mega-metros, not smaller communities. Even though the latter are what still dominate our pastoral-romantic imaginations. An interesting question is âwhat is the right sizeâ? I think the Bay Area/New York region are about the upper limit. More than that and you get too-big things that are short-lived and go supernova too quickly. Too much smaller than that and you get the subcritical kinds of pre-Industrial communities.\n3. Thatâs of course just the material bottom of Maslow, but it is also clear that in terms of higher-level well-being, metros beat cities, cities beat towns, towns beat villages, and villages beat tiny bands of hunter-gatherers. Deirdre McCloskey tackles this angle head on in her work, by busting the peculiarly American myth that people in small communities are happier and people in cities are âalienatedâ or something. Quite the reverse. There IS a big difference though: traditional contexts are forced patterns of association inherited from kinship structures (usually oppressive). Modern mega-metro contexts and online interactions catalyze voluntary patterns of association. A world of difference in terms of well-being each kind of collective catalyzes.\n4. Regarding individual imagination versus collective, certainly, I grant that. Iâll contest the idea that collective imagination requires community in the sense of close-knit, cohabiting tribal groups or something. In fact, the best works of collective achievement have relied on impersonal institutions rather than personal ones. To take the cliched example of Apollo, that was not a paleo-village type social structure/container. It was a complex set of institutions that embodied *impersonal* patterns of trust. Sure there were much more tribal patterns within those structures, but you canât claim all credit for collectives! I think modernity works precisely because it blends impersonal institutions and personal structures in ways that allow each person to be as individualistic or communitarian as they personally choose to be, and still get the benefits of being part of complex systems. Successful fusion of Gesellschaft, Gemeinschaft, market mechanisms and âpricelessâ tribal mechanisms (and yeah, I donât buy that line that markets organize nothing of value: thatâs the tired line about knowing the price of everything and the value of nothingâ¦)\n5. Still mulling the ugly/beautiful angle and wondering whether your notion of beautiful simply reduces to pastoralism or whether there is more there. I personally like word pollution. I think it is hilarious to do that sort of thing to the solemnity/gravitas of high-culture art :)\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae9f7ddba15354b88918c96ab1f96854?s=48&d=blank&r=g)MausÂ says\n[March 5, 2015 at 11:37 am](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233000)\nWRT your #2 above, both NYC and S.F. are geologically constrained, one is an island and the other a peninsula, so the permeable boundary condition that Sarahâs posits acts in this instance to limit the growth of the human population. Additionally, the economic forces that are dominant in both locations act to foster a sort of induced tribalism, i.e. the vast majority of residents are going to belong to the same socio-economic class and the marketing directed toward them will be concentrated in a narrower range. Contrast London or Los Angeles, which can spread out in suburban sprawl with much less geographical constraint. It seems to me that these two much larger cities have a greater diversity of distinctive neighborhoods. I lived in San Francisco in the late 1980s, when an apartment was ten times less expensive then as compared to now. At that time, the neighborhoods were much more distinctive. The massive influx of tech lords has led to a homogenization of the 49 square miles of the City.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/af9da17a4142d5cc3ece2b87381ddb41?s=48&d=blank&r=g)[Kevin](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/)Â says\n[March 5, 2015 at 8:32 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233060)\nVenkat, you said almost everything that I wanted to say in reply to this â so thanks, saved me a lot of trouble :).\nBut now Iâm left in limbo between two competing schools of thought about whatâs âgoodâ for human beings. Historically Iâve planted myself firmly in the material-well-being camp. Letâs just make sure everyone has clean water, good access to school and medicine, freedom to choose their [whatevers] â all of which implies that metros and big individualistic states are the best thing to happen to us. I mean they arenât without their downsides, but on net theyâre good for us.\nOTOH, most of what Sarah wrote here resonates with me personally. I was never happier than when I was saturated in my ritual-rich âtribeâ of ~1000 primates [https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/10/29/anthropology-of-mid-sized-startups/]. Not sure how much you remember, but you saw my office once, and it would be hard for me to describe what I liked about it better than how Sarah put it:\nâThe work of elaborating an aesthetic together, as a small group, providing context for each otherâs selves.â\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/07d1d1b93d48f50f75959590076e61a4?s=48&d=blank&r=g)[Venkat](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/about/)Â says\n[March 5, 2015 at 10:47 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233076)\nLimbo is kinda what Iâm going for here as an editorial direction for ribbonfarm. Sort of an idea hedge-fund, so to speak. I too have a fundamental bias towards taking material well-being seriously, possibly because I grew up in a part of the world where most people around me had very little of it. Easy to romanticize the squalor of lack of material well-being when you have it.\nThat said, I also take the beyond-material-well-being stuff just as seriously, and I donât think thereâs any real paradox there. But there probably IS a paradox between communitarian/individualist drives. Hell-is-other-people vs. hell-of-solitude. And corresponding heavens.\nI think thereâs far wider variation on that than communitarians think. So to me, the challenge of this post is to pull out the stuff I agree with, while bracketing the totalizing bits that are always part of a communitarian perspective but donât necessarily survive a port to a pluralistic framework (for example, ugly/beautiful judgments have to be bracketed).\nAt some point, I will do a post mansplaining all this to Sarah :P\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae9f7ddba15354b88918c96ab1f96854?s=48&d=blank&r=g)MausÂ says\n[March 6, 2015 at 12:53 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233147)\nAh, the betwixt and between of Limbo â neither here nor there, neither this nor that. I struggle with the communitarian versus individualism poles because I am an extreme extrovert who needs interaction with others to energize. But, as I learned from an earlier essay of yours, I am also a Wowbagger. I certainly donât suffer fools gladly and fools seem to predominate at every level of community I find myself in beyond the narrow confines of family and close friends. I donât know what the solution to this dilemma is, but ideas are a great anodyne. So ribbonfarm as an idea hedge fund serves as an excellent Beatrice in this particular limbo.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9ef1c0c5f1761dfdf8a680704bf4a1f8?s=48&d=blank&r=g)Dan L.Â says\n[March 24, 2015 at 10:58 am](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-235901)\nThatâs of course just the material bottom of Maslow, but it is also clear that in terms of higher-level well-being, metros beat cities, cities beat towns, towns beat villages, and villages beat tiny bands of hunter-gatherers. Deirdre McCloskey tackles this angle head on in her work, by busting the peculiarly American myth that people in small communities are happier and people in cities are âalienatedâ or something. Quite the reverse.\nWithout specifics about what research establishes this with so much certainty, all I can say is that this conclusion contradicts my personal experience and intuition as well as my understanding of the anthropological research along these lines. I feel that âlove/belongingâ, âesteemâ, and âself-actualizationâ are all actively suppressed by living in a bureaucratic, consumerist society.\nNot only that, but from what I understand hunter gatherer bands tend to be low conflict and incredibly happy. Not a hard-and-fast rule, but egalitarian hunter gatherer bands are routinely described that way.\nOf course, cities are better if youâre seekingÂ __novelty__Â specifically, but I donât ânoveltyâ anywhere on Maslowâs hierarchy. Otherwise, the city environment (one in which youâre definitionally surrounded by strangers all the time) seems pretty alienating to me.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/179d1e94c5b4d364c0e8cd0f95a775b7?s=48&d=blank&r=g)[mtraven](http://omniorthogonal.blogspot.com/)Â says\n[March 4, 2015 at 10:18 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-232925)\nSome random reactions (I am in mostly-complete agreement with this excellent post):\nIÕm guessing you know that the line âgood fences make good neighborsâ is not the point of the Robert Frost poem it is taken from â rather the opposite: âSomething there is that doesnÕt love a wallâ.\nRe democracy and ritual,Â [see here](https://omniorthogonal.blogspot.com/2007/09/voting-as-ritual.html%E2%80%9D).\nIÕve been researching Stewart Brand for a session at Refactor Camp, so thinking a lot about hippies, and this post made me see them in a new light â the 60s were in large part an aesthetic rebellion against the mid-20th-century modernist uglies. Brand and California bohemianism were one of the more successful branches of this rebellion. The WEC was explicitly aimed at supplying better âmaterials for composing a human lifeâ, in your phrase. Brand was also something of a ritual designer, and I think it is through Brand that most of us are familiar with Christopher Alexander.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ae9f7ddba15354b88918c96ab1f96854?s=48&d=blank&r=g)MausÂ says\n[March 5, 2015 at 12:04 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233001)\nThis was a very provocative read. I suppose the thing I am most likely to think about is the notion of the ideal human grouping for the realization of an objective aesthetics. If every individual is the judge of beauty, then there really is no standard and judgement about any particular artifact is impossible. If, however, a smaller group of committed aesthetes cannot advocate for a particular standard because their judgment has been tiled out of existence by Encorpera, the bland sameness oozes over every artifact. (I love Sarahâs example of clothing. I myself have adopted the âprotestâ uniform of a black knit polo shirt and khakiâs.)\nOne thing that struck me as incongruent in the essay was the critique of the âdrug war.â This sounded almost like a Libertarian manifesto of the individual set against the over-encroaching Government. Almost everything else in the essay relies on a communitarian or collective ethos, which is quite distinct from the individualism of recreational drug use. And I donât think the distinction is collapsed by suggesting that there may be a ritualistic (i.e. communal) role for using controlled substances. In my experience as a prosecutor, the genuine ritualistic use of a controlled substance, e.g. peyote by certain Native Americans, has a well-recognized cultural history. In contrast, the more frequent appeal to âritualisticâ use is by individuals who want to circumvent prohibition by creating post-hoc justifications. A good example is the number of medical cannabis users who have no real medical condition (i.e. cancer as opposed to ingrown toenail) but rely on the legal fiction to get high. Collective action in the case of medical cannabis is political action or a legal fiction so that users can obtain marijuana without having to resort to street-level black market transactions. It is rarely ritual in the sense that I suspect Sarah is using it. Though the Zion Coptic Church, which is an outgrowth of Rastafarianism, claims to use cannabis sacramentally.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c6f5d3dae3ca2ba8c6317c184cc9b693?s=48&d=blank&r=g)Sarah PerryÂ says\n[March 5, 2015 at 2:10 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233015)\nDonald E. Brown has proposed that âmood- or consciousness-altering techniques and/or substancesâ are a human universal; rarely in human history, however, are substances used in the individual, isolated manner in which they are used under drug prohibition in the United States. In no culture is it just a free-for-all; institutions evolve to help people use drugs well and safely, but those are prevented from ever evolving under prohibition. Instead, violence and degradation is ensured.\nI appreciate your making my point â that prohibition drives drug use toward isolation. ;) And my point is not the usual libertarian concern for *individual* use rights, though I do think we have the right to alter our own consciousness, but rather a concern that prohibition has destroyed the agency of small groups to use drugs in wholesome group contexts. (In many cultures, only experts actually use the drugs; everybody else participating in the ceremony does not â as with Maria Sabina in my earlier essay in this series.)\nI chose to talk about the drug war because it is a concrete way that âtiling structuresâ destroy (in a top-down manner) the possibility for certain states of consciousness â but it is hardly the most important one. States of consciousness are the âformsâ I care most about; âmental statesâ are, under my view, pretty much the only important thing, and everything that exists, exists to create or maintain them.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/500da6763830fd77eea32591235e7c6c?s=48&d=blank&r=g)ChangÂ says\n[March 5, 2015 at 3:40 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233025)\nMuch of the ugliness you describe is probably contingent. In The Nature of Order, Christopher Alexander offered the 15 transformations as a reliable way of enhancing wholeness and beauty, and there is no reason why such transformations cannot be applied to systems with modern fashion or words/fonts (neither of which should be viewed as monolithic). Of course I may just be biased as a stylish person :P, but it seems most people stop experimenting due to the ease of achieving ugliness, and revert to safe combinations of t-shirts and jeans, which mostly arenât even fitted to the human organism in the first place.\nIt was great that you considered non-physical boundaries, especially information ones as emplaced by rituals. In Terrence Deaconâs Incomplete Nature, permeable autopoietic boundaries are indeed necessary and sufficient for self-hood and agency. Of course in a network topology, relative scarcity of connections itself acts as a boundary.\nYour mention of black boxes reminded me of black box ontologies, which according to Andrew Pickering characterized cybernetics, in that knowledge of the interacting systems is not required for action, since the systems can adapt and regulate each other. Rituals are like a deeper homeostatic layer that maintain the system through changes enforced from without, yet the deeper homeostasis of human psychology may lead us to abandon rituals even before we have found replacements, at some cost to our mental wellbeing.\nThe problems with giving up such evolved patterns of behavior are those described in James Scottâs Seeing Like a State and Nassim Talebâs Antifragile, for instance in a recent tweet when Taleb realized that fasts like Lent are not merely meant to act as sacrifice rituals to maintain religious identity or provide nutritional benefits for humans, but also had health and ecological benefits for farm animals.\nThe part about solutions spreading like plagues in highly connected networks is like abandoning the wisdom of crowds, where guesses do not converge to the mean but are affected by the anchors. Local fit is also lost in such cases, leading instead to solutions that fit the system and perpetuate the conditions for their reproduction.\nTiling structures are like attractors or what Deleuze called singularities, patterns or points on the fitness landscape which tend to be produced and reproduced, especially when sustained by stable parallel loops as described in Muralidhar Ravuriâs Pervasive Loops. Perhaps the strongest tiling structures cannot externalize like economic products, but wage Boydian moral-mental-physical war, bringing and keeping others in play in an infinite game, aware that self-interest includes altruism, as explained in Liu & Hanauerâs Gardens of Democracy. These structures would also self-propel into a Serendipity Singularity, as long as they are not snuffed out in their nascent stages.\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8134b890796bfb6d03070ea2b6f1299e?s=48&d=blank&r=g)[Kartik Agaram](http://akkartik.name/)Â says\n[March 6, 2015 at 2:32 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233156)\n1. Iâm very happy to see Notes on the Synthesis of Form get more exposure. Itâs by far the best of Alexanderâs books, I think.\n2. The problem isnât insufficient boundaries, but too many boundaries. Something there may be that doesnât like a wall, but itâs in nature, not in human nature. Human nature (or at least analytic western tradition) seems to love dividing tangled systems into zones like in your figure above. Each boundary is imposed on the basis of local concerns, but without holistic cost-benefit consideration. Once imposed itâs hard to move or remove boundaries, because of the fear of destructive consequences. Hence heuristics like Chestertonâs fence. I tried to explore these ideas inÂ https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/04/09/the-legibility-tradeoffÂ (though itâs not nearly as well written as this post).\nTo quote myself: âOur institutions are plagued by a tendency to forget the precise scenarios they were designed for, dooming them to either forget history and repeat mistakes (âregressionsâ in programmer-speak) or to continue cargo-culting old solutions long after theyâve become obsolete.â (https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/01/15/resident-bloggers-for-2014-sam-jordan-kartik-keith)\n3. The number of things we both referred to is quite crazy: Christopher Alexander, Robert Frost, Go stones, Chestertonâs fence, the resource leak bug (but then Iâm a programmer).

In an extended rehearsal process for a live performance, you get many options to repeat your performance, try again, see how it flows from one moment to the next, how your scene partner responds to you, etc. In film you donât get the opportunity to do that. Scenes are shot out of order, often without the other people there, and so you need to adopt acting strategies that you assume will fit without having genuine information on whether the fit works. If you make big, bold acting choices, they are unlikely to fit because they come off as ham-handed unless they are very well-motivated. And so we get more and more absent deliveries of lines as written, or canned imitations of emotional responses that are acceptable for television audiences. It becomes acting that is âmore of an apology for existing than a performance.â\nWhen it works, live theater is SO MUCH MORE FUNNY than film. Part of this is just that you are in a large group of people, and laughter is mostly socially mediated, but itâs also due to the fact that the actors can breathe and act in response to the audienceâs response. I think that the traditional division between audience and performer is important for the compartmentalization that you talk about, and directors break this distinction far too nonchalantly because they assume that itâs always better to have audience interaction. (Not saying that it isnât a great and important way to do art, just that people whip out alienating pseudo-Brechtian crap as a lazy way to make a performance more âinterestingâ without considering what that does to everything else in the performance.)\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8134b890796bfb6d03070ea2b6f1299e?s=48&d=blank&r=g)[Kartik Agaram](http://akkartik.name/)Â says\n[March 9, 2015 at 7:42 pm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/#comment-233556)\nThe notion ofÂ [Heterotopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopia_%28space%29)Â seems relevant.

I would maybe add the idea that in gardening even if a strategy yielded good results in the past, continuing to do it indefinitely will almost certainly lead to disaster.\nFor example, if you are adding certain types of fertility to the soil you will usually see increased returns from your crops, but if you keep going there will inevitably be a residual mismatch between inputs and outputs every cycle, leading to some nutrients being over-accumulated and others depleted over time. This to me is the big danger of the most modern form of agriculture where the same land is used in the same way for indefinite periods. Even simple crop rotations donât completely reset the imbalances. I get the impression that older forms of agriculture were more shifting and opportunistic, with small patches of cleared cropping land cycling back into the wilder pasture management approach for long stretches of time. Real ecosystems also behave the same way, with species shifting in space and time.\nIt also reminds me of the Savory approach to management where you pretty much assume you didnât make the right decisions in the last cycle, and always keep a wide view on possible variations of approach. I know from my own farm some of my biggest successes were from random experiments that I never thought would come to much. With age I am learning to devote more time and energy to those agnostic approaches to problem solving.\nBlogchains\n[Captain's Log](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/captains-log/)\n[Domestic

People Are Saying]] #[[vgr]]\nsource:: https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/\n#[[Quotes]]\nThere is a renaissance underway in online text as a medium. The Four Horsemen of this emerging Textopia are:\n[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), a hypertext publishing platform best understood as a medium for composing conspiracy theories and extended universes.\n[Substack](https://substack.com/), a careful and thorough ground-up neoclassical reconstruction of the age-old email newsletter.\nStatic websites, built out of frameworks likeÂ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)Â orÂ [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/)Â (full disclosure: a consulting client).\nAnd finally,Â [Threaded Twitter](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205983999274840064), a user-pioneered hack-turned-supported feature that has wonderfully revitalized the platform.\nI want to take a stab at lightly theorizing this renaissance. And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of blogging. And the future of books. So itâs going to be a sprawling, messy hot take on the State of Textual Media. Or at least a simmering take, since Iâve been thinking about this stuff for a year on the backburner.\nThe text renaissance is an actualÂ __renaissance.Â __Itâs a story of history-inspired renewal in a very fundamental way: exciting recent developments are due in part to a new generation of young product visionaries circling back to the early history of digital text, rediscovering old, abandoned ideas, and reimagining the bleeding edge in terms of the unexplored adjacent possible of the 80s and 90s.\nI imagine, to traditionalists already bemoaning the slow decline of print-based media like books, newspapers, and magazines, these technologies I want to talk about might seem like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. But whether they strike you as renaissance or apocalyptic technologies, theyâre here, so letâs meet them.\nRoam [_]([[What People Are Saying]])\nRoam attempts to implement a near-full conception of hypertext as originally conceived by visionaries like Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson. Iâve been using it for a couple of months now. Itâs a revelation what a thoughtfully implemented version of a powerful vision can do to unexpectedly transform something you think you understand deeply at aÂ [FingerspitzengefÃ¼hl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl)Â (finger-tips feeling) level, like I think I do writing.\nOn the surface, Roam looks like a cross between a slightly weird wiki and a note-taking tool like Evernote. Itâs not. It implements a few key features of 1980s vintage hypertext visions â block-level addressability, transclusion (changes in referenced blocks being âtransfer-includedâ wherever they are cited), and bidirectional linking â that utterly transform the writing experience at the finger-tips level. You end up organizing high-level structure as you work at fleshing out low-level chunks of information, because the UX collapses high and low-level thinking into a single behavior.\nSo you can write, structure, organize, refactor, bundle/unbundle, all in a single subconsciously learnable flow. You donât have to think consciously about this: it gets compiled down to finger-tip skill as you use it. This is the sort of product I was dimly groping around for, and trying to build at Xerox 10 years ago. I wasnât smart enough to pull it off, and back then, the technology wasnât there either anyway. Now the tech is there, and thereâs someone on the scene smart enough to pull it off.\nI met up with Roam founder [[Conor White-Sullivan]] last week in San Francisco and had a nice long walk-and-talk chat around the Mission with him. People who pull off impressive feats of visionary product engineering often donât quite recognize what theyâve done, but thatâs not the case with with Conor. He knows what heâs doing, he knows the history (akaÂ [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze)) of the product heâs built, and heâs got the opinionated approach I look for when adopting a commercial product. Heâs also nailed the essential message-of-the-medium use case of Roam: conspiracy theories. Or alternately, extended-universe building. Weâre in a fake-news world and we might as well get good at it.Â __Good__Â in both senses of the term.\nIt can also do note-taking, workflows (like kinda-sorta competitor Notion), and wiki-like knowledge management, but those use cases are not as interesting to me. Conspiracy theories and extended universes, in the best senses of those terms â escaped reality construction might be the general category â is what RoamÂ __wantsÂ __to be about.\nThe name, incidentally, is a play-on-words joke apparently. As in Rome wasnât built in a day.\nThreaded Twitter\nThreaded Twitter is perhaps the most interesting and weird of the Four Horsemen of Textopia.\nWhile the unwashed masses flock to non-textual media like TikTok, we Very Online cognoscenti know that Twitter is where all the history-making, universe-denting social media action really is. It is as close to a pure ideas-commons/digital public as weâll ever get.\nA big part of the reason Twitter has ascended to this position is threading. The idea (originally known as tweetstorming) was invented as a simple workaround hack by Marc Andreessen back in 2014, to get past the 140 character limit. But a bunch of young pioneers rapidly turned it into a creative medium in its own right. Visakan Veeraswamy is among the best known at this point (heâs publishingÂ [a whole book of his threads](https://gumroad.com/l/friendlynerdbook)Â which I suspect is a first for the medium), but there are several others. At some point Twitter grudgingly started supporting threading as a feature (and in the process took control of how threads were displayed, an annoying but reasonable move). Services likeÂ [Threadreaderapp](https://threadreaderapp.com/)Â emerged to turn threads into longform documents.\nIn December, I accidentally instigated what ended up becoming an entire festival of threading, which I retroactively dubbed Threadapalooza 2019. I basically challenged people to do 100-tweet threads (optionally, in the case of mutuals, based on prompts from me), using the popularÂ __1 like = 1 tweet__Â protocol (which I didnât invent, though many people assume I did). Hereâs aÂ [meta-thread of 100 threads](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205983999274840064)Â that I compiled. A lot of the content was genuinely spectacular. There were excellent threads on architecture, macroeconomics, Trump, trauma and healing, and all sorts of other topics. Go browse the meta thread and read a few. If youâve been thinking Twitter is a cesspool of civilizational decay, prepare to change your mind. Itâs pretty much the center of the renaissance.\nMy prompt went sort of viral, and several hundred more threads were created by people I donât know. All in all, it was a wonderful outpouring of deep reserves of creativity and knowledge, the likes of which I havenât seen online in a long time. Several participants turned their threads into blog posts, and in one case,Â [an actual newsletter](https://innovationatscale.substack.com/)Â (on Substack!), so Iâm kinda proud of what I managed to provoke.\nItâs hard to convey what the hell happened during the two weeks the event was live, if you werenât on twitter. But with a spot of Tom-Sawyerish whitewash-the-fence flattery, bullying and cajoling, I got a bunch of people to join me in adding some meta-structure to the event, so on top of the threading frenzy, a sort of meta-event emerged.\nIt began with Dorian TaylorÂ [writing a script to scrape the threads](https://gist.github.com/doriantaylor/f89caee7badb1581fd8b9799477fdcae)Â into a data hairball, which many others used to create visualizations.\nThen Our Man in Russia,Â [Artem Litvinovich](http://orbides.org/), got in on the act and made a video showing how the action unfolded.\nThen Ian Johnson, d3 maven, created thisÂ [really nice navigable dashboard-like view](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/threadapalooza-2019)Â of the event.\n![](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-1024x377.png) [link](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/threadapalooza-2019)\nAndrew Benson created a pretty consolidated visualization of the race:\n![](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa-1024x256.jpeg)\nLars E. SchonanderÂ [did some crunching](https://theaggregate.substack.com/p/the-aggregate-december-23rd-2019)Â to create a whole bunch of more wonky visualizations of what happened: rate of Likes, Likes to Tweets ratio, a moving leaderboard etc. Hereâs a sample:\n![](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lars-1024x717.png)\nMy own contribution to the meta-event, besides being the whitewashing-the-fence instigator and compiler of threads, was to do ongoing cheerleading featuring the mascot of the event, Ascii Text Critter.\n![](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/critter-672x1024.png)\nThis is the current state of the art. Threading is clearly a very rich and complex medium, with a huge amount of potential.\nWeâve barely scratched the surface of whatâs possible. If an almost-accidental event with some random volunteer hacking can lead to such a rich expression of creativity in both content and container, thereâs a lot more to explore and develop here. All the hacks people pulled together suggest that if the technology comes together in the right way, Threadapalooza could become the template of a whole new kind of virtual conference. If I were 20 years younger, Iâd be trying to create a startup to build such a product.\nGiven Twitterâs track record though, Iâd bet that the threading revolution will not actually unfold on Twitter itself. Thereâs a 50-50 chance they will do something boneheaded to mess up the potential, and starve out any products that attempt to build anything good on the quicksand of insecure attachment thatâs the Twitter API.\nSo other products will actually take this energy places. But one way or another, the future is going to be threaded.\nMy own personal attitude towards Twitter is one of continued bewilderment, though Iâve been on it since 2007 and have 4 accounts on it (the largest, @vgr, with >30k followers at this point). I think Iâm fairly good at twitter, but I still donât quite know what Iâm doing there or why. Perhaps thatâs for the best.\n[[Roam Change Log]]\n19:31 Just deployed [[Mobile Quick Capture]] \n\n

But grow.\nIâm trying an experiment in Roam, and Iâm excited to share it, because itâs changing the way I take notes.\nIt started with reading something that Andy Matuschak wrote, about having a âtaxonomy of notesâ.\nHe talks about the different kinds of notes you can take, with the idea being that youÂ **slowly build upwards towards more and more structure**, as you think about any given topic. (I highly recommend looking at what he has to say on this topic himself, in his online notebook, which he recently made publicly visible in an act of wonderful generosity â see below â and thanks, Andy!).\n(Warning: itâs a pretty magical place, and you probably will want to explore this notebook in more detail.. so set aside some time if you canâ¦ itâs worth it.)\n**Andyâs notebook entry**\n(P.S. â you can click within this rectangle, to view it in a separate tab):\n{:tag :h2}Taxonomy of note types{:tag :h3}\nTODO: flesh this out; write a note for each note type; etc:\n\nFor me, the practice of writing and revising notes is, atâ¦{:tag :h4}notes.andymatuschak.org\n\nhttps://notes.andymatuschak.org/Taxonomy_of_note_types)\nAfter reading this, I put together some tags that I can use in Roam, inspired by Andyâs taxonomy.\nI am now using â[[ð²1]], [[ð²2]], [[ð²3]], and [[ð²4]]â as hashtags, whenever I create a new note.\nThis is shorthand for what I am calling âEvergreen note - level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4â.\n__(speed tip: I use the âtextblazeâ browser extension to make hotkey combos to type those tags â¦ that way, a short keystroke combo generates each of those complete hashtags â complete with square brackets and âevergreen emojiâl â in just a few keystrokes, whenever I want the tag.)__\nNew pages that I write, now have an attribute line â (tags) â right beneath the page title, and on that line, I use one of those 4 tags to tell me which âclassâ of evergreen note that page is.\nThere is a hierarchy here, and you can read about it in Andyâs words in his notebook (above), or you can let me give you my version , belowâ or both.\nBelow, Iâm going to illustrate the concept using a real-life project that I just started: I am organizing my knowledge about theÂ __physiology of sleep__.\n(P.S. In addition to creating these tags, I created a âprocess pageâ or âmeta-pageâ about the whole concept; my process page looks like this:)\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/393/1*_bCU5Tvbofe8C2CtSg1P-Q.png)\n(a new page in my Roam notebook)\n**âLevel oneâ evergreen note - aka [[ð²1]]:**\nAndy calls this a âstubâ â I also like to think of it as a âplaceholderâ or even a â__cognitive__Â __hail Mary pass__â.\nThis is where you are free-writing and you suddenly realize that somethingÂ __*might*Â __come in handy later as a conceptual placeholder, so you go ahead and make it into a topic, without really even knowing what will connect with that topic.\nOften, you just have a hunch that something will be useful. So you set aside some space for it, and let the details arrive later.\nExample:\nIâm researching sleep â and the first thought I have about it is that it is a âregenerative processâ. So on the spot I create a new page calledÂ **[[regenerative processes]]**. That page is an example of a [[ð²1] page.\nItâs a stub, and itâs likely to broadly associate with lots of other topicsâ¦ in the long run, it will be a place where I can associate with other regenerative processes of all kinds, where I can examine the biology of equilibria and homeostasis, dynamic equilibrium, entropy in living systems, and whatever other big topics I might at one point want to connect all this to. But for now, itâs a place-holder, but itâs one that, I know, will grow, the more I write.\nBroadly speaking, this is a concept-level page. Think of it as the view from the sky.\n**2. âLevel twoâ evergreen note -aka [[ð²2]]**Â â\nThis is the level of neatly defined concepts, or as Andy writes, âterms of artâ â that is, the concept-knowledge building blocks that you need in order to start thinking about a complex topic.\nIn my sleep example,Â **[[Sleep Phases â NREM and REM]],Â **a page in which I map out my definitions, terms, and foundational knowledge**Â âÂ **that**Â **would be a âlevel 2â note.\nIt is a place where I can elaborate on what sleep phases are, because other, more complicated building blocks, are later going to arise from this foundational concept.\nI will, I imagine, at some point be elaborating on more advanced hypotheses about the phases of sleep, but I need to define some terms, first, in order to elaborate those hypotheses. These are my level 2 notes.\n**3.**Â â**Level 3â evergreen note (aka [[ð²3]]) â**\nThis is where, I think, things really start to get interesting!\nWhat Andy suggests is that at this level, the notes have titles that are, essentially, short, declarative statements, that can be supported by what you have written or cited elsewhere.\n(From my perspective, itâs at level 3 that your own ideas first occur, because if level 1 was about defining areas of the house that you were going to fill, and level 2 was about defining the objects you were going to fill them with, then, at level 3, for the first time, you are working on describing and declaringÂ __relationships between the objects in your mental houseÂ __â or your âmagic junkyardâ, to borrow a descriptor I first read used by Anne-Laure Le Cunff)\nAs I build my sleep notes little by little, I might eventually be ready to title a page something like this:Â **[[Sleep is a process-state, during which vital neurophysiological housekeeping processes occur]]**.\nAndy goes on to enumerate some of the keys to writing a good âLevel 3â note â that such notes should beÂ **âpreciseâ and ânarrowâ**; (in that sense, they function much like the process of questioning by a skilled lawyer in a legal case, where the goal is to be really careful and incremental, carefully making only such claims as you can back up with your work elsewhere.)\nNote that a claim can have broad implications, yet still ontologically be âpreciseâ and ânarrowâ â as is the case with my exampleâ¦ for example âAll men are mortalâ is a veryÂ __precise__Â claim â albeit, one with significant implicationâ¦\n4. â**Level 4â Evergreen Note [[ð²4]]â**\nThese notes are the âmetaâ notes, that start to build on ideas you have developed across multiple lower-levels of notes. Andy compares these notes to âAPIâs, in that they then become useful âhandlesâ for developing ideas at the highest levels of complexity.\n**A level 4 note is built on top of one or more level 3 notes.**\nHere I am just going to quote Andy directly, because his description of this highest-level of note is succinct and clear:\n__(once again, note that if you want to go directly to Andyâs notes, you can click on his underlined terms below)__\nWhenÂ [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)Â are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire noteâs ideas can then be referenced using that handle.\nIn fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develop ideas in notes over time, and improve the âAPIs,â youâll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. â[[notes.andymatuschak.org/Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium]]â, [[notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen Note Writing as Fundamental Unit of Knowledge work]]\nSome effective note âAPI designâ techniques:\n**separation of concernsÂ **([Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic)),\n**sharp titles**Â ([Prefer declarative and imperative note titles to sharpen claims](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Prefer_declarative_and_imperative_note_titles_to_sharpen_claims)), and\n**positive framings**Â ([Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Prefer_positive_note_titles_to_promote_systematic_theory)).\nFor example, in my own writing about sleep, I might find thatÂ **[[Sleep is a process-state, during which vital neurophysiological housekeeping processes occur]]Â **(â¦ that was my level 3 exampleâ¦)\nLater I might develop more âlevel 3â notes, to assert that, e.g.:\n**[[Dreaming occurs predominantly within the REM phase of sleep]]Â **â¦**Â **and**Â [[REM sleep occurs at the end of each sleep cycle]]**Â â¦\nand finally I think I can synthesize these statements into an exploratory âlevel 4â statement, which could beÂ **[[Hypothesis: The physiologic housekeeping in stages NREM 1â3 includes processes that âprimeâ the brain to dream in REM, the final stage of the cycle]]**\nAnd that, I think, is âlevel 4ââ¦ in which Iâve linked some ideas from my existing level 3 notes, in order to form a new hypothesis, one that is atomic, separate, and positive, and built out of what precedes it.\nConclusions:\n(i.e. why does this matter, and why should you bother with the hashtags?)\nI started this experiment in order to teach myself to be more deliberate, about the kinds of pages I was creating in my Roam notebook. The simple act of hesitating and thinking about âWhat level-of-page is this?â has encouraged me to be more thoughtful, in general, about how I organize my knowledge, and more specifically, about what kinds of pages I am creating, and why.\nIn that sense, you could think of the [[ð²1]] â [[ð²2]] â [[ð²3]] â [[ð²4]] tags as âtraining wheels for the mindââ¦ Iâm not necessarily going to use them forever, as I expect that at some point the âsortingâ of pages will become instinctual for me, and then (maybe) my use will fade.\nHowever, there is another value, too â I can search for those hashtags and thereby get a âlevel-by-levelâ view of my own notebook-workspace â summarizing at a glance where my broad concepts are, where my âterms of artâ are, where my âbuilding blocksâ are, and where my âcompound building blocksâ have taken me.\nIf this has been useful to you, please let me know!

One of my favorite thinkers, and an archetypal activist-inventor.Â  Small details in the presentation of his papers make his work even more delightful. For instance, he makes it possible to hyperlink to specific paragraphs in MagicInk, or 'skim' a long talk in Media for Thinking the Unthinkable. He does in his presentation of ideas all the things I wished we could have done at HuffPostLabs.\nCore Ideas::\n1) Inventors can and should be driven by a core theme for how to improve the world just as activists are\n2) The progress of mankind is built upon the progress of the our ability to externally represent and manipulate thoughts (ie before the arabic placeholder numeral system, only elite roman mathematicians could multiply)\n3) The way we present information online is usually awful. It does not need to be.\nPaper:: [[Magic Ink]]Â http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/\nThis is the resource I most highly recommend to anyone designing anything on the web today, it is especially important for UI designers working in the journalism field. The fact that it is from 2006 and still cutting edge is a little mind blowing and a little depressing.\nIn his words:\nAlthough this paper presents a number of concrete design and engineering ideas, the larger intent is to introduce a âunified theoryâ of information software design, and provide inspiration and direction for progressive designers who suspect that the world of software isnât as flat as theyâve been told.\nMost useful for people who work on the internet, academia or in media, but also for a general audience of anyone who has to present information. I recommend highly.\n4) The way we write code sucks, because computer scientists/engineers/hackers don't look at history (of the field, particularly stuff done in the 70s-90s), don't challenge assumptions, and like having/being a priesthood. This is holding humanity back.\nPaper:: Â http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/\nTalk:: The Future of Programming (he presents in 2012, pretending to be a guy in 1970, showing that the worst fears have come true, and best hopes have not been realized.

When there are major changes coming, it is good to have some real diversity of culture in case we all get swept up by a mind-virus (see that Neil Stephenson book -- diamond age, and snow crash\n[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s [[Junto]], and the ideas of efficient learning, feedback loops, and collective intelligence and voluntary mutual aid all stuck out to me as part of a similar theme because I was already thinking about what an open-source or peer-to-peer political and social movement would look like.Â  I was already willing to take for granted that networks (if built on the right infrastructure) would be smarter, more resilient, more free, and more just, than anything managed by institution regardless of whether who owned it. Victor's ideas stand out mostly because of how they support better ways of thinking and communicating, which are key to really doing collective intelligence well).\nI def came across exponential thinking through [[Ray Kurzweil]], he also gave me the idea of trying to skate to where the puck is going to be (knowing how long it takes to develop an idea or company, and starting to work on it years before the market is lined up so you release it right on time). His stuff on transhumanism and the singularity is super super interesting, and really relevant to this when we talk about why we need a resilient culture and social infrastructure. But a lot of people have either heard it, or it scares them or sounds too weird to be plausible, so I'm torn on how much to use. At the core it is the same idea as Engelbart's Law and the feedback loops that create the Pareto Principle, his writing will have lots of examples besides Moore's law of these accelerating change phenomena.\nRelated -- [[Alan Kay]] talking about 10 year horizons (lots of his talks hit this theme)\n[[Roam Demo Videos]]\nShowing off [[Keyboard Shortcuts]] to [[David Perell]]\nTriggers for roam\n`[[` to open autocomplete for pages\n`/` for the \"good shit command\" \n`((` for autocomplete for blocks\nfor dragging thing\nhold the option key\n((uuidf0d5b5eb-5491-4a0c-a44d-5a7e645ea4b3))\n[[Workflows]]\nWriting in Roam [[Writers]]\n16:25 - \n[[Demo]] with [[Kevin Rose]]\n1.

April 2003\n__(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.)__\nIn the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup calledÂ [Viaweb](http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html). Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface.\nA lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.\nAnother unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]\n**The Secret Weapon**\nEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\" and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts. Finally, the truly serious hacker should consider learning Lisp:\nLisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages you do want to use, like English.\nBut wait a minute. This metaphor doesn't stretch that far. The reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it. If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. But Lisp is a computer language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer, tell them to.\nSo if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he? I'm not trying to make fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.\nWhy not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. And if it doesn't, then who needs it?\nThis is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. And when you're starting a startup, you feel this very keenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. You either get rich, or you get nothing. In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.\nRobert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But we also knew that that didn't mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you'd be running Windows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.\nThis is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can't do what all the other startups do. I don't think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.\nThe average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you're running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.\nThe same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you'll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you're in trouble.\nBack in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few understand even now: when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. When you're writing desktop software, there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.\nThis new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.\nIf you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it's done.\nIf other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take.\nSo you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.\nWhat were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn't have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.\nIt must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. No one was leaking news of their features to us. We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.\nWhen I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy ofÂ __The Day of the Jackal,__Â by Frederick Forsyth. The main character is an assassin who is hired to kill the president of France. The assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president's route. He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.\nOur secret weapon was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. But now it worked to our advantage. In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.\nAnd so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb. We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio. This was no accident. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. If they didn't know what language our software was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that way.[2]\nThe people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It let them build great looking online stores literally in minutes. And so, by word of mouth mostly, we got more and more users. By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. At the end of 1997 we had 500. Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. Today, as Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market. It's one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping. I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.\n**The Blub Paradox**\nWhat's so great about Lisp? And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't everyone use it? These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers. Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. And the reason everyone doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. Of course, both these answers need explaining.\nI'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement: programming languages vary in power.\nFew would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine language. Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. This idea is even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.\nEveryone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]\nThere are many exceptions to this rule. If you're writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. If you're writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster. And if you're writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task. But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language.\nYou can see that machine language is very low level. But, at least as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all treated as equivalent. They're not. Technically the term \"high-level language\" doesn't mean anything very definite. There's no dividing line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other. Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power.\nConsider Cobol. Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that it gets compiled into machine language. Would anyone seriously argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python? It's probably closer to machine language than Python.\nOr how about Perl 4? Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures got added to the language. Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl 5 is more powerful than Perl 4. But once you've admitted that, you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another. And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.\nThis idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though. After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.\nProgrammers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm going to use a hypothetical language called Blub. Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.\nAnd in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either of them. Of course he wouldn't program in machine language. That's what compilers are for. And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how anyone can get anything done with it. It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice).\nAs long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.\nWhen we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub. How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn't even have y.\nBy induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can't trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.\nI know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing programs in Basic. That language didn't even support recursion. It's hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but I didn't miss it at the time. I thought in Basic. And I was a whiz at it. Master of all I surveyed.\nThe five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum. Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic. What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top. And to support this claim I'll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. How can you get anything done in them, I think, without [[macros]]? [5]\nMany languages have something called a macro. But Lisp [[macros]] are unique. And believe it or not, what they do is related to the parentheses. The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses in the language just to be different. To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird. But those parentheses are there for a reason. They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between Lisp and other languages.\nLisp code is made out of Lisp data objects. And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. Lisp code, after it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.\nIf you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax. You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed. But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. You can write programs that manipulate them. In Lisp, these programs are called [[macros]]. They are programs that write programs.\nPrograms that write programs? When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you think in Cobol. All the time, if you think in Lisp. It would be convenient here if I could give an example of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that? But if I did, it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn't know Lisp; there isn't room here to explain everything you'd need to know to understand what it meant. InÂ [Ansi Common Lisp](http://paulgraham.com/acl.html)Â I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to [[macros]] until page 160.\nBut I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% [[macros]]. Macros are harder to write than ordinary [[Lisp]] functions, and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not necessary. So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other language. However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of [[Lisp]], this ought to make him curious. We weren't writing this code for our own amusement. We were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to put technical barriers between us and our competitors.\nA suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some correlation here. A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages. The resulting software did things our competitors' software couldn't do. Maybe there was some kind of connection. I encourage you to follow that thread. There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches than meets the eye.\n**Aikido for Startups**\nBut I don't expect to convince anyone ([over 25](http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html)) to go out and learn Lisp. The purpose of this article is not to change anyone's mind, but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it isn't widely used. In a competitive situation, that's an advantage. Lisp's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don't get it.\nIf you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn't worry that it isn't widely understood. You should hope that it stays that way. And it's likely to. It's the nature of programming languages to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use. Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the processor. At places like MIT they were writing programs in high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued to write code in machine language well into the 1980s. I bet a lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor, like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them out by switching to a risc instruction set.\nOrdinarily technology changes fast. But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They're half technology and half religion.[6] And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg. Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be a good thing. Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now, just barely, on the radar screen. [[macros]], introduced by Lisp in the mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.\nObviously, the median language has enormous momentum. I'm not proposing that you can fight this powerful force. What I'm proposing is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you can use it against your opponents.\nIf you work for a big company, this may not be easy. You will have a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over the world. But if you work for a startup that doesn't have pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub paradox to your advantage: you can use technology that your competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be able to match.\nIf you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here's a handy tip for evaluating competitors. Read their job listings. Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.\nDuring the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.\n**Notes**\n[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp, which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written in C, which handled orders. The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small. Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.\nIn January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written in C++ and Perl. It's hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code. (SeeÂ [Greenspun's Tenth Rule](http://paulgraham.com/quotes.html).)\n[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't have understood why: \"If they were that smart they'd already be programming in Lisp.\"\n[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.) The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B. But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions.\n[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order.\n[5] It is a bit misleading to treat [[macros]] as a separate feature. In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features like lexical closures and rest parameters.\n[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly neutral that they're really works of anthropology. People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic. But the question is only half a religious one; there is something there worth studying, especially if you want to design new languages.\nExamples:: [[Clojure]] [[Racket]]\nA family of [[Programming Languages]] that was [[Discovered by]] [[John McCarthy]]\nA special property of lisp languages is their [[macros]]\n{{attr-table: [[Examples]]}}\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2F9JlGiDXs_c?alt=media&token=2a01ac8c-ea50-488f-ad6a-40bd9084b2a1)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)\n-- 15:07\n[[OnDeck]] demo\n{{[[DONE]]}} Show off [[GTD]] type system in Roam [[April 25th, 2020]] #scheduled #[[Highest Priority]] [[Josh]]\nMany people don't realize that you can link directly to every bulletpoint in Roam \nAnd \nthat these [Block refs]([[Block References]]) are also [Bidirectional]([[Bidirectional Links]])\nThat you can wrap a reference to a page or block in a markdown link to provide it with an alias. \nType `((` to bring up autocomplete for a bullet\nType Command-K to write a markdown link `[link text]``(address)`\nMarkdown links can wrap blocks `[x]``(((blockid)))` or pages\nTo show a quick example of this workflow\n{{[[DONE]]}} Create a [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] game in Roam\n1\nYou are in a dark house\nTurn on the light [2](((2DMVgPLoe)))\nLet your eyes adjust to the dark [3](((GbME1MXOe))) \n2\nYou see a zombie down the hallway\nAttack it with a bat ((tLSm9jkwQ))\nRun away ((7TjtjAJBF))\n3\nYou hear a sound from down the hallway\nMove Forward in darkness ((7TjtjAJBF))\nTurn on the light [2](((KO6piiS-H)))\n4\nYou have been eaten by a zombie\n[Write your own adventure]([[Choose Your Own Adventure]])\nStart again [1](((rjyzahYJ1)))\n5\nYou crushed the zombie\nClick [here](((rjyzahYJ1))) to start\nClick [here](((rjyzahYJ1))) to start\n23:06 -- 00:07 (1 hour) \nWant to do some quick comparisons between [[It's Time To Build]] and the [[Roam White Paper]]\nGoals::\nOne of the underlying motivations for [[Roam]] is to build a more [[Anti-Fragile]] or at least [[Resilient]] [[Civilization]], and I suspect there are differences of opinion between myself and [[Marc Andreesen]] on the what the underlying cause is to the current failures of our institutions and what the path is to build better institutions\nI suspect we're pretty closely aligned though\nI want to get more articulate about what I think the problems are, and work a bit off his thinking and past writing I did with [[Richard Meadows]] to do so\nProvide a demo video showing how I use Roam to approach a thinking problem\na problem of exploring past writing, and current writing to come to a more articulate position / have new ideas. \n{{[[DONE]]}} #[[Choice]] How to approach the problem\nOptions:: \nStart fresh by writing what I think the problems are\nList it out in some sort of structure\n{{[[TODO]]}} #[[Choice]] what structure\nOptions:: \nFree form, essay style, structure later\nList problems\nthen reasons\nList set of claims about the world, then group\nDecision::\nStart by collecting the problems from the [[Roam White Paper]] that I think are relevant to this topic, using that collection to figure out the things I haven't yet said\n{{[[DONE]]}} #[[Choice]] How to collect it\nOptions:: \nTag the page, then pull out quotes, then decide how to structure things\nDecision::((QHyujhwAh))\nStart by going through [[It's Time To Build]] and pulling out the most interesting points related to this topic\n{{[[TODO]]}} #[[Choice]] What to call this topic -

In 2020! In America!\nWe also donât have therapies or a vaccine \nâ despite, again, years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses. \nOur scientists will **hopefully** invent therapies and a vaccine, \nbut then we **may** not have the manufacturing factories required to scale their production. \nAnd even then, weâll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast enough to matter \nâ it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourgeâs 2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives.\nIn the U.S., we donât even have the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid off workers and their families, and many millions of small businesses, are in serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer them money without potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to distribute money to us when itâs needed most.\nWhy do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to â specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*.\nYou donât just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.\nYou see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We canât build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential â which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also canât build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBOâs âWestworldâ wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didnât film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin â they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?\nYou see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isnât that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; weâve been doing education research thatâs never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why havenât we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?\nYou see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know â and weâre experiencing right now! â the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why arenât we building Elon Muskâs âalien dreadnoughtsâ â giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost â all throughout our country?\nYou see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?\nIs the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? Iâm with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we donât know â all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldnât have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.\nThe problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents donât like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things.\nAnd we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.\nThe right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.\nItâs time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.\nThe left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge â build new things and show the results!\nShow that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective â how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why canât 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldnât regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building â energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so letâs build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?\nIn fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we donât, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price. Whatâs the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.\nBuilding isnât easy, or weâd already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. Weâre all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.\nEvery step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work youâre doing isnât either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, weâve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems â we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.\nI expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Hereâs a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? Thereâs an excellent chance Iâll agree with you.\nOur nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and thatâs to build.\n[[Conor]]\nNoticed that it was now over a year ago that I drafted a [[Tweet Storm]] about [[Thought Algorithm]]s in my personal Roam -- but I never got around to polishing it up -- literally haven't looked at it since, though it has been on the back of my mind that I should be out in the open - [[A Brief Rant on the Structure of Thought: Why Evernote is a Terrible Second Brain]]\nI'm concerned I won't tweet it out in the near future, so putting it here \n[[Debugging Algorithms of Thought]]\nI've noticed that some of the ideas that have felt most useful or powerful to me\nWhat does Vipassana Meditation have in common with @tferriss 's approach to pareto optimum skill acquisition, Charlie Munger's Mental Models, @fortelabs building a second brain, Non-Violent Communication, and the Double Diamond Design Process, and critical path analysis?\n -- they're all instances of Thought algorithms -- \n -- Higher order functions that abstract over a space of complex problems.\nI like thinking of them this way, because it is more obvious (to me) at least what is happening when I execute them than if I were to call them for instance \"Strategies\"\nTheres a pattern here, I'm going to try to make clear -- and it makes more sense if you think about these procedures as functions\nThey take thoughts as input, and they tell you how to transform those thoughts into new thoughts\nBut they're multi-step -- you take a stream of inputs, transform them (mapping over them, filterig them)\nThe big benefit to having a receipe \nA few years ago, I got particularly excited about a particular class of these thought algorithms -- the ones that relate to effectively learning a new field\nTim Ferriss' approach was a big inspiration \nHe convinced me that, in following the right algorithm, you could dramatically accelerate the path to mastering some skill\nI think these algorithms are particularly popular for auto-didacts, because (when you're entering a space of unknown) like learning a new field, it is especially important to feel like you have a plan you can trust.\nIf at every step of the way, you're wondering (am I wasting my time), or doubting the activity you're doing, then you're much more likely to give up.\nAt the same time, its true that if you go about learning something \"the wrong way\", its incredibly easy to waste your time and not make much progress.\nTim Ferris's gave sort of an existence proof that (if you followed the right algorithm for learning a new skill), you could have potentially orders of magnitude better results than taking a conventional approach. [[DiSSS or D3S Method]]\nDeconstruction:  Break the skill into smallest learnable units\nHe had fantastic hacks for deconstruction -- like finding a world class performer who lacked the \"natural talent\" and thus you could expect would have had to find the true \"fundamentals\", particularly one who was no longer in the spotlight, and then interview them\nSelection:  Select the units that have the highest return\n1000 words make up like 80% of the writing in a language (focus on those, and the words that matter to the domain you care about)\nSequence: Identify the right order to learn the thing\nIf you learn the 100 words that are most important for conversing and asking questions, you can get to a place where practice is both enjoyable, and something you can do all the time.\nI found a number of other algorithms for this -- my favorite being\nScholarship: How to do it effectively \nWhich taught me both how to download textbooks for free, and convinced me that finding the best textbook (as a starting point) was completely worth it, compared with trying to piece together information from blog posts and youtube videos (those are excellent supplements, but not the fastest way to build a scaffold)\nProbably the most influential for me though was Mortimer Adler's How to Read a Book\nHis algorithm is for how to extract knowledge from a text\nRead the table of contents\nRead the index\nRead the introduction and conclusion\nSkim the book, (focusing on places where they author is summarizing their thoughts or spelling out key definitions (like the introduction and conclusion)\nSpend 80% (my number) of your time, on the truly great books that will stretch you -- give you new ontologies -- that have ideas worth grabbling with and presented as clearly as is possible for the idea.  \nDefinitely don't worry about finishing all the books you've read\nLook for key questions, arguments, and terms\nPull the author into conversation with the other authors on the topics (try and figure out where they agree and disagree)\nTry and map out their [[Ontology]] and underlying world view\n[[Junto Research Clubs]]\nI got so hooked on this idea, that at one point I organized a bunch of \"peer to peer research groups\" where we would all follow this algorithm (sort of a hybrid of Adler's process and Ferriss)\nWe created a standard process for how to Deconstruct the things we were trying to learn -- a way of approximating what the best sources would be,  selecting the most significant units, and sequence learning those units so we could gain mastery faster\nGoal obviously not being to cut corners -- but to focus on what is most relevant and fundamental -- if you can learn more efficiently, you can learn more, and thus bring together ideas from different fields \nObviously this was the sort of thing best done as a group (if you're exploring a new domain, and expect that some units -- which you don't know in advance, are going to be MUCH higher leverage than others, you want each person to go off and explore on their own -- then the group to exploit the best opportunites that each individual finds, and then do the same for each new domain that opens up based on your new knowledge)\nWe more of a focus on stakes (you had to pay $40 if you skipped the meeting, or failed to complete your reading and breaking down your book)\nI've noticed that this framework in particular [[Pareto Principle]] -- [[Collaborative Explore-Exploit]] has really shaped my worldview and directed my work. Also though, just noticing the impact of this [[Thought Algorithm]] has sort of kept me cued up to find other ones (and has motivated me to look for better ways of working with them)\nRelated [[The World Makes Sense. That is why we can have nice things.]]\nOther examples I mention above \n#Double Diamond Design Process\nMight not use this one\n#Points of Leverage in a System\n#Byron Katie's The Work\n[[Byron Katie]] is particularly powerful -- I used it once, sort of thing that I used once to solve a major relationship conflict -- had a similar experience with [[NVC]], but then noticed that I (while I didn't follow it so exactly in the future), it subtly shifted a lot.  Like other algorithms, its the sort of thing that worked incredibly well, but took effort, and didn't follow exactly again after, but showed me this different frame that then adjusted things subtly in the future\nAll the techniques taught at [[CFAR]], and the whole research space\n[[Double Crux]], [[Internal Family Systems]]\nIt opened me up to ideas like the one from [[Plato]], that [[There is no such thing as willpower, we just implement whatever we believe to be the best strategy]]\nAnd as a result, when you're having motivation issues (or procrastination issues), it is due to some set of underlying beliefs\nSome part of you believes that staying up until 4am playing Sid Meir's Civilization is the best use of your time, or yelling at your partner is the best way of getting your needs met, or beating yourself up about failure is the only way to ensure future success/acceptance/love/safety -- and that this conflict in your mind is the root of you \"getting in your own way\".\nWhich is to say -- the belief in thought algorithms (in general) lead me to pay particular attention to ones that look promising, and these have (I believe) pretty fundamentally shaped who I am (and how I interact with the world).  But as I said -- this \"belief\" in [[Thought Algorithm]]s (particularly in conjunction with my belief around [[Collaborative Explore-Exploit]]) also has inspired my work.  It lead me to building a non-linear writing tool.  Why?\nNote -- I'm motivated to share this due to [[Simon Syneak]] Thought Algorithm of [[Start With Why]], and I feel fine sharing this arguably self-promoting idea due to [[Gary Vanderchuck]]'s idea of [[Jab Jab Hook]]\nFor one -- due to a problem I ran into when i was [[Do things that don't scale]] in by running those peer to peer research groups [[Junto Research Clubs]]\nSo -- what was the problem?\nWell, in the aforementioned research club -- we were following a particular process.  << [[JRC-Process]]\nIdentify possible sources\nFilter for best guess at best sources\nWe would search sub-reddits (particularly for things like, best way to learn arabic characters)\n[[The Best Textbook on Every Subject]]\nEach person takes a book\nDeconstruct the book, using [[Analytic

\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1fC3u5Wya_r2vs7uFrAuFRhtzp_4fiUsTn1y7limmlqQ/edit\nNote -- this is from 2013\n[[Slide Deck]] of [[How to Read A Book]]

but even though I knew the plan, it was still really helpful to have a scaffold\nWhen I set [[Pomodoro]] timers, and had the process written out (somewhat in the form of a worksheet) -- it was much easier to manage my attention\nThis was doubly true when other people were trying to both [[Learn the Process]] and execute it at the same time.\nWe had sub-process for each stage (deciding how to frame the question, finding sources, analyzing sources, building a learning path, following the path)\nThere is a reason that [[Byron Katie]] provides an ACTUAL [[Worksheet]]\nI think this is supported by [[Andy Clark]]'s ideas of [[Extended Cognition]] and [[David Kirsch]]'s ideas of [[The Intelligent Use of Space]]\nYou can focus all your attention on the task in front of you\nYou don't have to worry about remembering what you're doing next\nThus it is easier to maintain momentum -- especially on cognitively difficult tasks.  \nYou're able to project manage yourself\nBeyond just helping people have less cognitive overhead while doing an inherently difficult thing (exploring a new field) it was also much much easier for people to collaborate and learn from each other's research, and build on each other's work when we were all following a similar enough process\nSo, what I ended up doing was creating a sort of [[Workflowy]] [[Templates]]\n[[Example]] \nBook\n----\nAuthor ---\nKey Questions\n1. ----\nAnswers \nAuthor's Proposed Answer\n1. ---- \nExample\n1. ----\nQuotes\n1. ----\nReasons\n1. ---- \nInvalidated Answers\n1. -----\nReasons \n1.  -------\n[[Meta]] -- [[Todos]] -- [[Styling]] -- We should introduce [[Workflowy]] type grid-lines, when the dots are in view, and in that re-factor, also have option of turning off bullet-points from view.  -- could also refactor so not in a tree, but that's probably too much of a stretch\nYou might be able to guess at the obvious problems with using a structure like that\nWorkflowy was great for input -- but the structure of the information we were trying to collect was really poorly suited to a tree (particularly for the things we wanted to do, AFTER we collected out the key ideas)\nRemember, the next steps after [[DS3: Deconstruction]] are [[DS3: Selection]] and [[DS3: Sequencing]]\nThe same question or concept for example was being addressed in multiple places throughout the book -- (during reading, we often wanted to break things down by chapter), but then you also wanted to relate the questions to each other, and filter out most important questions in a book for sharing with other people on the team\nThere was this [[Many to Many]] relationship between questions claims and terms, and chapters -- even just within the same book -- and Workflowy didn't represent that.  \nYou could use links to point to different parts of the tree using links -- but those links only worked in one direction (similar to [[Quote-tweet]]s) -- so you'd have to put 2x as many links if you wanted to be able to go from high-level questions to detailed questions and move back.\nThe problem only got worse when you were trying to connect ideas across books and resources\nThis is possibly a strange problem to run into -- the only other person I've seen who has run into this exact problem was someone who supervised a team of researchers who were reading medical papers and trying to create custom [[Meta-analysis]]es for [[Rare Diseases]].\nTheir goal was to help clients make sense of a bunch of hard-to-parse research data and make suggestions on what interventions would actually be appropriate\nProbably not a coincidence -- this is also the person who has gotten most exited about the tool we've been building.\n[[Sarah Constantin Endorsement]]\nThey also found that lack of good tooling for this problem made their project far more difficult to execute on -- and despite having a really stellar team, and substantial funding -- that bottleneck looks like it may have broken some of the economics needed to make the project really viable. \nI also found that -- not having good tools for taking the following steps beyond Deconstruction really made me question the worthiness of continuing down the path using Workflowy.  \nThe quotes we were collecting, summaries we were writing, and links we were drawing was all clearly DATA -- but when there was very little we could do with the data -- (besides just read and think) -- it was much harder to justify the extra effort.\nI looked at what we were trying to do (and the pattern of [[Thought Algorithm]]s in general) and clearly there was some abstract problem to solve here -- so the obvious answer (to a tech bro) -- write some software! $$\\red{\\text{A}}$$\n[[Learning to Code Backstory]]\nProblem then -- I had been a mostly non-technical CEO, and was more than a bit traumatized over sale of my first company (CTO had lost faith in vision and in me, so had to sell to get a soft-landing (first world problem sure -- but had really felt like selling out and triggered huge amount of self-loathing/imposter syndrome))\nI also felt like I needed to walk-the-talk of this whole [[DiSSS or D3S Method]] of [[DS3: Deconstruction]] deconstructing knowledge -- and at the time I was running these research groups (later condensed to 8 hour \"Learnathon\" meetups) -- the hard thing everyone wanted to learn was web-development.\nSo, obvious answer was -- STFU and deconstruct web-development until I was a skilled enough engineer for really skilled people to actually want to work with.  -- Biggest fear was being pointy headed boss from Dilbert. (Also lit says people only like working for people who could actually do their job)\nAlso -- try and figure out character flaws that caused first CTO to lose faith in me in the first place.\nResult of that process brought me to [[Clojurescript]] and starting [[CLJRC]] \nI found, what I perceived and perceive to be the 20% that produced highest gains -- datalog, and then found experts in that community -- provided value to them by connecting them to each other -- and giving them a [[Thought Algorithm]] of [[Hamming Questions]] and the [[The Art of Science and Engineering]] \"If you know what you're doing in Science, you shouldn't be doing it\"\nSelection got me focused on the ideas of [[Bret Victor]] and [[Doug Engelbart]] -- and learning design\nSo -- what are the abstract problems? from $$\\red{\\text{A}}$$\nSee [[Thought Vectors]] tweet from [[Samim]]\n1. Template -- I want to be able to specify a structure (particularly of questions I'm going to ask)\nShould be able to specify up front a [[Thought Algorithm]] -- a plan that you are going to go through\nEach step in the algorithm requires thinking -- but there were some generic structures (similar to programming concepts)\nFor example\n[[Brainsort]] for [[Sort a [[List]]]]\n[[Deslider]] for [[Reduce]]\nIn my case -- its the selection of material, the deconstruction of the material, filtering, and then sequencing\nYou should be able to focus on each step -- one a time (so you don't overwhelm working memory)-- but still have it fit into the overall structure, and be able to use the output of each steps in other steps\nThose higher level steps being things like -- combining and comparing ideas with each other [[Reduce]], filtering out certain things [[Filter]], and generating new lists from applying a new question to the result of a previous operation [[Map]].\n[[Mapping Question]] -- [[Map]]\nI knew for example -- I'd ask a question, the answer to that question would be a list -- for each item in the list I'd then ask a different question \n(I might want to filter the list, or sort the list, or generate a new list by applying another question (or relation) over the old list)\n-- and on and on --  basically, I wanted to \"map\" a question over a sequence of thoughts to generate a new sequence, then map another question over that sequence\nThe key thing though is -- I wanted to see where each new thought had come from -- and also be able to use each thought in multiple different algorithms. $$\\red{\\text{3}}$$\n2. I want the results from one process to feed into other ones\nIf I have a list of people I respect, and for each of them I've found out their favorite book on the topic -- I want to be able to take that list of books from all those people, filter by topic etc.\n$$\\red{\\text{3}}$$  I wanted to be able to show others (and myself) Algorithm, and the intermediate results -- sort of like a step-through debugger (and I wanted the whole chain to be reactive to updates at any part of the process)\nFor instance -- If I have filtered a list of say \"potential features for an app\" based on some criteria like \"technical feasibility\", and my evidence for removing a feature from the list was based on some mistaken belief, I wanted someone else (or my future self), to be able to update that belief, and then have the feature be added back to the list of potential features.\nSimilarly, if I felt that something was true, and my argument for believing it was based on a research paper that later failed to replicate -- or was invalidate by another paper or argument, I wanted my future self (or a trusted collaborator) to be able to update the claim and all beliefs based on that one get flagged.\n4. I wanted a tool that reflected both the Hierarchy of Ideas, and the underlying network\nQuotes are part of books -- but the ideas they express are connected with all the ideas in all the books (and even your hierarchical structure should be fluid -- so you could organize books by author and by topic, and by things like what beliefs they've updated you on)\nArguments have a logical structure -- even if they aren't [[Deductive]], they still have some [[Probabilistic]] influence on one another\nIdeas also have [[Terms]], which authors use in different ways, so I want to be able to do thinks like [[Replace the Term with the Definition]] \nIf I have to copy and paste ideas all over the place, I lose the structure of the thoughts, its harder to [[Compose]] ideas -- build them up from one another. \n5. I wanted a tool that deals with irregularly shaped data\nWorkflowy and [[Wiki]]s are great for this\nYou can always just add another bullet for meta commentary or to follow a thought in some other direction\n[[Table]]s are bad for this\nHard to annotate the value of a cell\nWhen comparing some dissimilar items -- end up having to have columns for the set of all attributes on all the items -- leads to really hard to read tables.\n6. I want a UI that helps me focus my attention on exactly the part of the problem I'm going through at that moment\n[[Concept Maps]] and [[Mind Maps]]\n[[Workflowy]]\n[[Worksheet]]s and [[Typeform]]\n[[Annotations]] in [[Document Mode]]\n[[Table]]s and [[Faceted Search]] for comparing collections\n[[Filter]]s\nWhere are we at now -- [[Private]]\nFrom [[Conversation]] with [[Michael Merchant]]\nFirst thing you do in [[Brainstorm]]ing meeting is to brainstorm the [[Prompts]]\nExample of a question that generates more question\nSimilar to [[Make Just One Change]]\n[[Workflowy]], [[Excel]], [[Plectica]] -- [[Mind Maps]], [[Google Docs]] are all input devices for getting thoughts out of your head, and turning those thoughts into data [[Input Devices]]\nProblem is, there is nothing you can do with that data afterwords\nEach of those is good for different kinds of things -- each of those things they're good for is useful for a different part of the thinking process\nWhat is needed is a way of creating Streams of data transformation -- where the transformation is something you are doing with your mind (like answering a brainstorming prompt -- or comparing objects, or ranking options), and the whole pipeline is visible -- and reactive to changes you make at each step of the process.\nYou want to be able to \"play computer\" with yourself -- to step through the algorithm, to reuse the results of each step for other operations, and have changes flow upstream and downstream.\nDoug Engelbart called these [[Process Hierarchies]]\nWhat makes these processes useful?\nWhat shape do these functions takes?\nFirst they recognize that there is a TEMPLATE, for certain class of problems\nThe problems \nI'll start with one of my favorite examples of a thought algorithm -- Scholarship: How to Do it Effectively\nThey take one or more thoughts as input, and then run a transformation on those thoughts to bring you to the next step\nThis is one of my favorite examples\n[[DiSSS or D3S Method]]\n[[The Intelligent Use of Space]]\n16:37 - 17:43\nDemo of Roam\nShowing off Brainstorming / live Mashups\n((jM17NLOPV))\nShowing writing process\n[[Master's Thesis]]\n{{embed: ((XannkBkxv))}}\nthis is new text [*](((gAv0V7cVR)))\n((3K7bxoJRY))\n((KTPVbxSN_))\nNew Block Embed\n{{embed: ((BMjOJSUMW))}}\nMakes it possible to expand or collapse block-embed \nEasier to click in to edit too\n{{embed: ((EJPv4VXGN))}}\nAnd color notes differently as they are embedded deeper \nhttps://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1264110271976468480?s=20\nHover to see the bullet point of hosted block - right click it to open in sidebar, copy/block ref etc.\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FZ6pM8hzvV4.png?alt=media&token=bd3bb0c4-b607-4088-87e9-ffe8152a3f4c)\n{{embed: ((rooO4Vjh7))}}\nDesigned by the Roam user community.

This User Agreement applies to any and all Users of Roam, and specifies the general terms by which Roam offers its services to its users.\n**I. Using Roam.**\nWhile using Roam, User agrees that it will not:Â \nViolate any laws, third party rights, or Roamâs [[Privacy Policy]]; \nCircumvent or manipulate Roamâs Fee structure, the billing process, or Fees owed to Roam;\nPost or otherwise disseminate false, inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, or libelous content (including personal information);\nTransfer Userâs Roam account (including feedback) and User ID and/or password to another party without the express, written consent of Roam;\nDistribute viruses or any other technologies that may harm Roam, the Roam website, or the interests, information or property of Roam Users;\nCopy, modify, or distribute content from the Roam website, or misuse or otherwise infringe upon Roamâs copyrights and/or trademarks; or\nHarvest or otherwise collect information about Users, including email addresses and financial information, without each Userâs express, written consent.\nBy entering into this Agreement, each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that:\nIt has the legal right to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder;\nIt has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to, delivering an executed copy of each and any form required by Roam;\nThis Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of such Parties;\nIt has all necessary power and authority to perform its obligations in this Agreement; and\nIt has obtained all necessary consents, authorizations and approvals from any third party (including any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority) which may be required for such Party to execute and deliver this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, the release of any contractual obligations owed to any third party.\n**II. Service Availability; Cancellation by Roam.**\nRoam may change, suspend or terminate any Service, or change or modify its Fees at any time and at its sole discretion unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. To the extent permitted by law, these changes are effective pursuant to the terms of Article 1 and Article 2, Section III hereof.\nUser understands and agrees that Roam has no obligation to store, maintain or otherwise provide User with a copy of any content or information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.\nWithout limiting other remedies, Roam may limit, suspend, or terminate Roamâs Services and User accounts, prohibit access to Roamâs website, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to prevent User from accessing the Roam website if Roam believes in good faith that User is creating problems or possible legal liabilities, is engaging in fraudulent activity, or is acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Roam Terms and Conditions.\n**III. Fees.**\nRoamâs hosting services are subject to â**Fees**â, based upon the Roam Fee Schedule or based upon a separate fee schedule that is entered into directly by and between Roam and User in a separate agreement. Roam reserves the right to change its Fees from time to time. Changes to the Roam Fee Schedule are effective after Roam provides User with at least fourteen (14) daysâ notice by posting the changes on the Roam website.\nRoam may choose to temporarily change the Fees for Roamâs Services for promotional events or for new services, and such changes are effective when Roam posts the temporary promotional event or new service on the Roam website, subject to the conditions of such promotional events or new services.\n**IV. Limitation of Liability.**\nNeither Party will hold the other responsible for third party Usersâ actions or inactions, including comments written or posted on the Roam site.\nNeither Party will be liable for any loss of money, goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of the use of Roam.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and in recognition of the relative risks and benefits of this arrangement between User and Roam, the risks have been allocated such that the User agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to limit the liability of Roam to any third party for any and all claims, losses, costs, damages of any nature whatsoever or claims expenses from any cause or causes, including attorneysâ fees and costs and expert witnessesâ fees and costs, so that the total aggregate liability owed by Roam to User or to any third party shall not exceed the greater of (a) the total Fees User paid to Roam in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, and (b) U.S. $100.00.\n**V. Release.**\nIf either Party has a dispute with one or more Users, this Party releases the other Party (and their officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\n**VI. Access and Interference.**\nThe information on the Roam website is proprietary or is licensed to Roam by Roamâs Users or third parties. User agrees that it will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Roam website for any purpose without Roamâs express, written permission and consent.\nAdditionally, User agrees that User will not:\nTake any action that imposes or may impose (as interpreted by Roam at its sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Roamâs infrastructure;\nCopy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, or publicly display any content (except for Userâs information) from the Roam website without the express, written permission and consent of Roam and the appropriate third party, as applicable;\nInterfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Roam website or any activities conducted on the Roam website; or\nBypass Roamâs robot exclusion headers or any other such measures that Roam may use to prevent or restrict access to the Roam website.\n**VII. Privacy.**\nRoam views protection of Userâs privacy as a very important software principle. Roam will use Userâs information only as described in the Roam Privacy Policy.

Roam reserves the right to use third parties to verify and certify Roamâs privacy principles. For a complete description of how Roam uses and protects Userâs personal information, please see the Roam [[Privacy Policy]], available on www.roamresearch.com.\n**VIII. Indemnity.**\nIf any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneysâ fees, is made by any third party due to or arising out of a breach of this Agreement or violation of any law or the rights of a third party by a Party to this Agreement (the â**Offending Party**â), the Offending Party will indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (and their officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from such claim or demand.\n**IX. No Agency; Advice.**\nNo agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.\nUser understands that Roam is not qualified to give either legal advice or tax advice regarding prospective transactions or otherwise, and User shall not rely on Roam for advice on such matters.\n**X. Notices.**\nExcept where explicitly stated otherwise, such as in Article 1 and in Article 2, Section III hereof, notice shall be served on Roam's Delaware registered agent (in the case of Roam) or on the agent or representative that User provides to Roam during the registration process (or to the Manager, agent, representative on file in Userâs Roam account at the time of notice, if different) (in the case of User), where the law requires such service. Alternatively, Roam may give User legal notice by certified mail to the address provided during the registration process, where the law permits such service. In such case, notice shall be deemed to be complete on the day the certified mail receipt is signed by User or Userâs Manager, agent or representative.\n**XI. Governing Law.**\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and of the United States without giving effect to the doctrine of conflict of laws.

This license does not apply to content in private databases. **Furthermore, while Roam has the technical ability to access private content, we agree to never access private content without written or verbal consent from you - excluding cases where we are compelled by legal authorities.** As part of the foregoing license grant you agree that (a) the other users of the Service shall have the right to comment on and/or tag your public Content that you make available to them and/or to use, publish, display, modify or include a copy of your public Content that you make available to them, and (b) we have the right to make any of your public Content available to third parties, so that those third parties can distribute, make derivative works of, comment on and/or analyze your Content on other media and services (either alone or as part of a collective work); except that the foregoing (a) and (b) shall not apply to any of your Content that you post privately for non-public display on the Service.\nBy posting Content that is set for public access to the Service, you grant us the right to display such public Content on and through the Service. Roam has the right but not the obligation to monitor all Content provided by users. In addition, any Content found on or through this Service that is not originally submitted, posted, or displayed by Users of the Service is the property of Roam or used with permission. You may not distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, download, repost, copy, or use said Content, whether in whole or in part, for commercial purposes or for personal gain, without express advance written permission from us.\nYou agree that Roam has the right, but not the obligation, to remove any Content from the Service if Roam determines in its sole discretion that such Content has violated these Terms, the Roam Privacy Policy, applicable law, or the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity, or if Roam determines in its sole discretion that such Content poses a risk of harm to Roam, other users of the Service or third parties.\nAny content stored on the Service will be stored indefinitely, unless it is explicitly deleted. This process is described in Article 2, Section XIV, Termination or Cancellation of Agreement.\n**II. Copyright Policy.**\nWe respect the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to respond to any claim that Content posted on the Service infringes on the copyright or other intellectual property rights (\"Infringement\") of any person or entity. It is our policy, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly Infringe copyrights or intellectual property rights of others.\nIf you are a copyright owner, or authorized on behalf of one, and you believe that any content, materials or works uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Service have been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by providing our copyright agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):\nan electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright's interest;\na description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;\nidentification of the allegedly infringing material on the Service, including URL or other specific location on the Service where the material that you claim is infringing is located;\nyour address, telephone number, and email address;\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;\na statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.\n**III. Intellectual Property.**\nThe Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Roam and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Roam.\n**IV. Databases.**\nContent submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as âDatabases.â\nThere are two general types of Databases on the Service:\nâPrivate Databasesâ that can only be accessed by the user that created the Database, unless you choose to grant full editor access to another specific user(s). You may also choose to grant page-level permissions to another user(s) for collaboration, but they will not have access to the rest of your content. Databases are private by default.\nâPublic Databasesâ that can be accessed by anyone with the link. The user that created the Database retains administrative rights. You can allow the database to be fully editable by the public, or you can restrict access to be read-only.\nIn the Service, you can work across multiple Databases at once, meaning your single account can access your own Private Database(s) and different Public Database(s). Databases are completely separate, and you wonât be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer copies of Content from one Database to another). You can also export your User Content from your Databases for use outside of the Service via the application.\n**V. Accounts.**\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.\nYou may not use as a username the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, or a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization. You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene.\nYou may not use the Service if you are 13 years of age or younger. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of 13.\n**VI.

There wasn't a pricing page up when you signed up right? Why are we only giving you two weeks to try Roam when earlier users got to use it for months for free?\nI've done a terrible job communicating with folks on this list so far (we didn't even send out a confirmation email telling you you were on here!)- so I'll try to give you some context here.\n**Why there is a waitlist, why you had to wait so long, and why we're charging now**\nFirst, you should know that Roam is a relatively young company, we've been working at this for years, but until a few months ago it was just the two founders - and we were mostly bootstrapping through contracts with a few research labs who wanted early access to our prototype and a voice shaping the product.\nAbout 6 or 7 weeks back, almost immediately after we made our first full-time hires, and while we were in the midst of upgrading our backend to handle what was already very rapid growth, a number of people on youtube and twitter started raving about how Roam had changed the way they organized their mind and their life -- which lead to a huge flood of new users that was more than we were ready for. \nThroughout the following week, the experience of using Roam much worse became much worse for all of our users (we had multiple days where people could not use the product at all - or did not see reliable syncing of notes across devices) - and we decided that the right thing to do was to slow down our growth, put a temporary cap on new users, and make sure we could keep providing a great service for the people who need Roam the most.\nIt's cool to be the \"hot startup\" and \"shiny new thing\" but - for myself and my co-founder Josh especially - Roam is our life's work, and we see it as at least a 50 year project. What you see today is just the foundation, and one that took us  more than 5 years of research to set. Given that, we're very ok with some of they hype dying down if it means we have a more solid base to build on, and can build a trusting long term relationship with the people who love what we've built AND believe in our vision. \nThis is why we're giving the best deal (most features, lowest cost) to the people who are making a 5 year commitment to us this early - as you'll see below, Roam is more than just a tool - we've got an amazing community.   \nThis is why we're giving the best deal (most features, lowest cost) to the people who are making a [5 year commitment]([[Roam Believers]]) to us this early. We want to play long-term games with long term people, and reward the folks who are trusting us and helping fund the future of Roam for everyone. \nNow, the good news is - since we setup this waitlist, we've successfully upgraded our backend, so we can handle a much much larger user-base. Besides infrastructure upgrades, we've also shipped a lot of product improvements, like custom themes and local only graphs for privacy focused users who have notes they don't want to store in the cloud. We're much more ready for the \"big leagues\" now, but we still want to be careful.  Over 50,000 of you have joined this waitlist in just the past 5 weeks, and while we're very confident we can support you - we don't want to run into a situation where we grow faster than our systems can handle again. \nSo, for the time being - we aren't going to have any sort of freemium plan - our pricing is going to be a bit more expensive than most \"productivity tools\" you might be used to - and we won't be promising you that we'll meet all the expectations you might have if you're coming from other tools that have been around for ages - like Evernote or OneNote.\nWe know this will turn away some of the people who are just lightly curious what all the hype is about - but as you'll if you keep reading - we hope things like the [[Roam Scholars]] program don't turn away folks who are really excited to learn the power of the tool, but don't currently have the financial means to afford it.\n**Some Warnings**\nSince we're turning on payments - it's totally reasonable for you to expect more from us than a startup with a free beta. I want to be clear up front about some places we might fall short of those expectations.\n**1. There are definitely still going to be occasional bugs.  **\nFor example - we have 7 people in our shared team Roam right now, and every week or so we get a synching error where one of our teams notes end up moved to the wrong place.  In just the past few days, we heard from one user who found that images they uploaded weren't rendering, and another whose public read-only graph had suddenly become publicly editable. Earlier today, when I pushed out the code to allow new users to pay and start creating graphs, the first 10 or so users to try couldn't because of an error I let slide to production. (fixed before writing this email)\nWe do our best to fix bugs as soon as we find them, and to guarantee uptime as much as possible, but the team is only 6 people right now - most of them relatively new. We try to ship code quickly, and sometimes there are mistakes.  We haven't fully built out a customer support team (we will be hiring for that and other roles soon)- but if you have trouble it might take us a while to get to you.\n**2. We don't have all the bells and whistles you might expect from a hyped-up app. **\nWe still don't have a mobile app (though there are some really talented folks working on an unoffical app based on our upcoming API), and if you want a web-clipper for collecting highlights, you'll have to use one of the Chrome Extensions built by one of the passionate community of roam users that call themselves the #roamcult. The tool also isn't the most beautifully designed - but fortunately - if you're willing to put in a little effort, there are now a ton of much nicer themes for Roam that have built by our community. \n**3. We don't have the easiest on-boarding to help you discover all the features of Roam or the ways they can help you**\nFor some people - the idea of being able to easily find old notes, remix your ideas, and build simple systems for organizing all your projects and thoughts makes a bunch of sense immediately. For some people, as soon as they see it, they know Roam is something they've been waiting for for decades. You might be one of them.  For others, it sometimes takes a few hours of watching youtube videos, chatting with other users, and experimenting before Roam really \"clicks.\"  Again, this is a place where #roamcult has done far more to support each other than we could as a team - and we highly recommend checking out the great courses, articles and demo videos they've created -- many of which you can find on roambrain.com or roamtips.com (both sites made by passionate users).\nIf you try Roam out, and find yourself confused and underwhelmed with what all the buzz has been about - that's totally OK!  Roam is meant to be a new way of organizing thoughts that more naturally fits your brain (it actually builds on some ideas from back before the web). Our goal is to make a medium for thinking in that helps you solve problems and have insights you otherwise wouldn't have. For many of our users Roam already it already is that -- but it's still very early days for us, and the tool definitely still has a bit of a learning curve. If we're not for you today, I hope you don't decide to write us off forever.\n**Finally - a few final words on pricing.**  \nLong term, our goal has always been to be more than just a personal tool for notes or tasks - from day one our mission has been to change how people learn and think together, to create a new medium for collaborative discovery and problem solving. \nRoam __is__ more expensive than many other \"software as a service apps\" you might have looked into, but this isn't because we only care about helping rich people or folks in developed countries.  We're expensive because we know that for the folks who really get into Roam, we deliver a LOT more value than $15/month, and because we want to build a stable economic foundation so that we aren't always chasing VC cash. \nWe want to have a solid enough business that we can hire the best people in the world to solve the problems that we think are critical to building a more intelligent, creative, and cooperative future, and we want to keep our focus on the long term, not the next boom and bust economic cycle. We also know that many people just aren't going to ready for Roam yet - and until word spreads, habits change, and our product matures - we're going to have to build that foundation on a user-base that is a quite a bit smaller than other companies you might compare us with - like Notion or Evernote.\nThat said - we are committed to trying to make Roam as affordable as possible for folks who desperately want to use all the power that this new kind of thinking tool offers.  To keep Roam affordable for folks who need it, we're launching - along with pricing - a Roam Scholars program, where Roamans for whom $15/month would be a serious financial burden can get a heavily subsidized plan. So - If you need help to be able to afford Roam - PLEASE just ask. We don't want to keep you out because of cost. \nIf on the other hand, you aren't strapped for cash, but just don't think there is any way a \"note taking app\" could possibly be worth more to you than a Netflix subscription - or if you think there is just no way this tool could be 3x more useful to you than something else that's offered for free -- we'd just ask you to poke around the #roamcult hashtag on twitter, or ask some folks in our community who've learned the ins and outs of Roam what they think. If it still isn't right now you, we hope you come back later when it is -- we do plan to roll out other pricing tiers in the future. \n \nFinally - if all of this is totally new to you - and you've only heard a few things about Roam, or haven't heard anything at all - WELCOME - I can't believe you read this far.  If you're curious about our company, who we are, how we got here, and where we're going - I recommend you check out this interview I did with Kevin Rose a few months ago, or this one with Tiago Forte (the \"productivity guru\", and greatest frenemy of Roam who 1/2 of you preferred to be your guide than a Magical Trash Panda -- poor choice! -- raccoons are far more resourceful than you realize!)\nThank you for your interest in Roam, and for waiting so patiently (or impatiently) for access. \nI hope you will find RoamResearch to be (if not today, then in the not very distant future) all you hoped for and more. I hope you will join us in making it that. \n \nMuch Love \nConor\nFloated idea of [[Local Only [[Roam Graphs]]]] and [[Roam Believers]] on [[Twitter]]\nhttps://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1265766040165728257?s=20\n03:24 \nShipped a super super basic version of custom javascript [[roam/js]]\nTo use\n type `{[[``roam/js]]}}`\n{{[[roam/js]]}}\n```javascript\nalert(\"Hello World\");```\nthen below that any code-blocks set to `javascript` will be loaded for each user who gives permission\nExample::\n{{[[roam/js]]}}\n```javascript\nvar x = prompt(\"What is your favorite color?\");\nalert(\"Your favorite color is \" + x);```\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FF3qgEYGGBU.gif?alt=media&token=ca4dd2b9-e264-411e-a22c-bb0e4ed9b5d4)\nMermaid is a markdown language for drawing diagrams based on text\nThis component will interpret all of the text indented underneath it - and - if it is formatted correctly, will render a mermaid diagram\nNote -- it does not play nicely with other features of Roam -- like [[Block References]] or [[Bidirectional Links]] - if you want to have the elements of you diagram be links you can click - or to include images or other richly formatted blocks - use the native Roam [[Diagrams]] which are also more **point and click interactive**\nDocumentation:: https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/\nStyling for [[Roamcult Themes]] https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/classDiagram?id=styling\nhttps://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor\nHow to use\ntype `{{``mermaid}}`\nText goes\nHere\nExamples::\n{{mermaid}}\nerDiagram\n        CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : has\n        CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places\n        CUSTOMER ||--o{ INVOICE : \"liable for\"\n        DELIVERY-ADDRESS ||--o{ ORDER : receives\n        INVOICE ||--|{ ORDER : covers\n        ORDER ||--|{ ORDER-ITEM : includes\n        PRODUCT-CATEGORY ||--|{ PRODUCT : contains\n        PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER-ITEM : \"ordered in\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n{{mermaid}}\ngraph TD\n\nA[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)\nB --> C{Let me think}\nC -->|One| D[Laptop]\nC -->|Two| E[iPhone]\nC -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]\n\t\t\t\t\t\n[[Gantt Charts]]\n{{mermaid}}\ngantt\n\ttitle A Gantt Diagram\n\tdateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n\tsection Section\n\tA task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d\n\tAnother task     :after a1  , 20d\n\tsection Another\n\tTask in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d\nDocumentation:: https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gantt\n{{mermaid}}\nstateDiagram\n\t[*] --> Still\n\tStill --> [*]\n\n\tStill --> Moving\n\tMoving --> Still\n\tMoving --> Crash\n\tCrash --> [*]\n\t\t\t\t\t\n{{mermaid}}\npie title Pets adopted by volunteers\n\"Dogs\" : 386\n\"Cats\" : 85\n\"Rats\" : 15\t\t\t\t\t\nHow do I update Roam?\nIn the top right the the ... menu, there is a button to \"check for updates\", click it\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2F4Ijp3Bc0lk.png?alt=media&token=03798765-c104-4abb-ba96-6864e2527fe9)\nIf your up to date you'll see this\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FldST-_ZTv0.png?alt=media&token=9a0f3544-499f-4bda-aa54-c3212884bd4f)\nIf there's an update you'll see\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2FxHwW9WnzmE.png?alt=media&token=2c444187-3a33-4a9d-9233-a2e2ea60ec22)\nJust click on the update button and you'll get the new version\n(if you have issues see ((rPMPZCOsC)))\nI clicked check updates, it didn't work/I don't see the new feature I'm looking for, whats going on?\nSometimes, updates can take awhile to reach you.

TheÂ [Lockheed P-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-80_Shooting_Star), the first jet aircraft deployed in the Air Force, took 143 days from project initiation to first deployment.Â [Marinship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinship)Â went from \"proposal\" to \"first ship completed\" in six months. The Apollo Program lasted 9 years from initiation to moon landing. While a lot happened in the US during World War II, it's easy to forget how short the period in question was: American involvement lasted 3 years 8 months and 23 days.\nMeanwhile, a BART extension is delayedÂ [more than a year](http://www.vta.org/News-and-Media/Connect-with-VTA/VTAs-BART-Berryessa-Extension-Update#.W5WFYEVKjUL)Â because the wrong networking equipment was installed.

This phenomenon may evenÂ [extend back further](http://crawlingaxe.blogspot.com/2012/02/19th-century-vs-20th-century.html)Â in the US. But it's not likeÂ __nothing__Â matters; GDP growth between countries does vary a lot, in both the short and the long run. So... what gives?\nResponses to this question:Â [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/economics/ad-hominem-gdp/),Â [JosÃ© Luis RicÃ³n](https://nintil.com/2018/11/19/on-the-constancy-of-the-rate-of-gdp-growth/)\n**How do you ensure an adequate replacement rate in systems that have no natural way to die?**\nSchumpeterÂ [claimed](http://web.uconn.edu/langlois/Creative%20destruction.htm)Â that the problem of capitalism is not how capital is allocated toÂ __existing__Â structures but how structures are created and destroyed. Systems and institutions inevitably get stale or become less effective but also work very hard to survive. (See also: theÂ [institutional imperative](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1989.html), Berliner's commentary on the \"[invisible foot](https://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Decision-Soviet-Industry/dp/0262520524)\", and Herbert Kaufman'sÂ [short book](https://www.amazon.com/Government-Organizations-Immortal-Herbert-Kaufman/dp/0815748396).) Bankruptcy takes care of senescent businesses. But how do we get a sufficient replacement rate in systems and institutions that aren't naturally subject to extinction processes?\n**How do we help more experimental cities get started?**\nIt seems that the returns to entrepreneurialism in cities remain high:Â [Hong Kong](https://www.amazon.com/Architect-Prosperity-John-Cowperthwaite-Making/dp/1907994696),Â [Singapore](https://www.amazon.com/Third-World-First-Singapore-1965-2000/dp/0060197765/),Â [Dubai](https://www.amazon.com/History-Future-Cities-Daniel-Brook/dp/0393348865), and others, have improved the lives of millions of people and appear much more contingent than inevitable. Maybe there could be far more of them. Beyond the direct benefits, city-sized areas enable regulatory experimentation that may, in turn, affect much larger regions. TheÂ [Shenzhen special economic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen_Special_Economic_Zone)Â was the first step in China's broader economic liberalization. (In addition to the books about the aforementioned cities, someÂ [related](https://www.amazon.com/Political-Economy-Special-Economic-Zones/dp/1138237817)Â [reading](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Next-Government-Stateless-Nations/dp/1316613925), and a relatedÂ [research organization](https://www.chartercitiesinstitute.org/).)\nHow can we encourage the creation of more cities and more experimentation in their rules?\n[[Mark Lutter]] wrote up someÂ [sub-questions](https://www.chartercitiesinstitute.org/post/charter-cities-questions).\n**How do people decide to make major life changes?**\nMost days, people don't decide to change their lives in big ways. On a few days, they do. What's special about those days? How much is it about the stimulus versus their own inner state?\n**Why are there so many successful startups in Stockholm?**\nLondon and Paris have surprisingly few successful tech startups for their size. Stockholm, a city of less than 1 million people, has Spotify, King, Klarna, iZettle, and Mojang, all valued at more than $1 billion. What's true of Stockholm that isn't true of other European cities? (Similar questions apply to Provo, Utah, and Tallinn, Estonia.)\n**Is Bloom's \"Two Sigma\" phenomenon real? If so, what do we do about it?**\nEducational psychologistÂ [Benjamin Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bloom)Â [found](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf)Â that one-on-one tutoring usingÂ [mastery learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning)Â led to aÂ __two sigma__(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the \"2 Sigma Problem\": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?\nIn a related vein,Â [this large-scale meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919)Â shows large (>0.5Â [Cohen's d](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_d)) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. \"Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented.\"\n**How can we better understand the dynamics of progress in science?**\nWe invest an enormous amount of time and money in science. Cumulative progress in science will probably do more than anything else to determine the shape of our collective future. In order to ensure that we're spending enoughâand doing so on the right things and in the right ways (maybe we should have more independent institutes, or more funding of promising early-career scientists, or...)âhow should we think about measuring the results?\n(It's interesting that this question doesn't seem to be analyzed more deeply. For example, the NIH spends about $37 billion per year, and yet there are essentially no books about the NIH, nor is there much investigation of the effectiveness of the allocation, despite some ostensiblyÂ [surprising trends](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.jpg).)\n__Michael Nielsen and I subsequently wrote anÂ [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/)Â on this topic for the Atlantic. See also the reading list atÂ [scientificreturns.org](https://scientificreturns.org/).__\n**Will end-user applications ever be truly programmable? If so, how?**\nEmacs, Smalltalk,Â Genera https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system) , andÂ [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications)Â embody a vision of malleable end-user computing: if the application doesn't do what you want, it's easy to tweak or augment it to suit your purposes. Today, however, end-user software increasingly operates behind bulletproof glass. This is especially true in the growth areas: mobile and web apps. Furthermore, not only is it getting harder to manipulate the application logic itself, but it's also becoming harder to directly manipulate yourÂ __data__. With Visual Basic, you can readily write a quick script to calculate some calendar analytics with Outlook. To do the same with Google Calendar is a very laborious chore.\nEnd-user computing is becoming less a bicycle and more a monorail for the mind.\nAs a consequence, we need ever more domain-specific software. Rather than use universal tools for handling charts and for manipulating data, we tend to use separate analytics packages for every conceivable application. This is not all bad. Domain-specific tools can maximize ease-of-use and help amortize the cost of complex, specialized functionality. Sublime's built-in â-T works better than every third-party Emacs package. Still, despite these benefits, the popularity of macros and browser plugins strongly suggest that users are smart and want more control.\nShould we just give up on our earlier visions of empowered users or is a better equilibrium possible?\n**What's the successor to the book? And how could books be improved?**\nBooks are great (unless you'reÂ [Socrates](https://www.units.miamioh.edu/technologyandhumanities/plato.htm)). We now haveÂ [magic ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/). As an artifact for effecting the transmission of knowledge (rather than a source of entertainment), how can the book be improved? How can we help authors understand how well their work is doing in practice? (Which parts are readers confused by or stumbling over or skipping?) How can we follow shared annotations by the people we admire? Being limited in our years on the earth, how can we incentivize brevity? Is there any way to facilitate user-suggested improvements?\n[[What's the successor to the scientific paper and the scientific journal?]]\nAre LaTeX'd papers and paid journals really the best we can do?Â [Peer review](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/peer-review-not-old-you-might-think)Â andÂ [modern scientific publishing](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)Â are quite recent phenomena. In different ways,Â [Distill](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/),Â [the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/),Â [Fermat's Library](http://fermatslibrary.com/), andÂ [Sci-Hub](https://scihub22266oqcxt.onion.link/)Â hint that improvement might be possible.\n**What's the right way to understand and model personality?**\nSince the 1980s, theÂ [five-factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)Â personality model has gained a great deal of traction. It is ostensibly applicable to a great deal of life. What are its limitations and in which situations should we use it?\n**Could there be more good blogs?**\nIt seems that they heyday of of blogging is passing. If so, that's unfortunate. Blogs can be a remarkably efficient mechanism for disseminating ideas and facilitating discussion and debate. (E.g.,Â [Sumner's arguments](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeconlib.org+%22by+scott+sumner%22+ngdp)Â for NGDP targeting.) Twitter is good, too, but there's lots that blogs are great for that Twitter can't replace.\nPart of the problem with blogs is that they're less rewarding than Facebook and Twitter: your post may perhaps get some thoughtful responses but it doesn't get immediate likes. And part of the problem is, of course, that writing a good post is much harder than writing a witty tweet.\nAre there incentive structure tweaks that yield more good blogging?\n**Why are programming environments still so primitive?**\nIn different ways, Mathematica, Genera, and Smalltalk put almost every other programming environment to shame. Atom, Sublime Edit, and Visual Studio Code are neat, but they do not represent a great improvement over TextMate circa 2007. Emacs and Vim have advanced by even less.\nWhy can't I connect my editor to a running program and hover over values to see what they last were? Why isn't time-traveling debugging widely deployed? Why can't I debug a function without restarting my program? Why in the name of the good lord are REPLs still textual? Why can't I copy a URL to my editor to enable real-time collaboration with someone else? Why isn't my editor integrated with the terminal? Why doesn't autocomplete help me based on the adjacent problems others have solved?\n**What does religion cause?**\nReligion is one of the biggest shapers of human civilization. Some of the effect sizes seem quite striking: Jews have won anÂ [amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates#Statistics)Â fraction of all Nobel prizes and Mormons in Utah show extremely strongÂ [upward mobility](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/why-low-income-kids-thrive-in-salt-lake-city/425214/). Schulz and othersÂ [claim](https://psyarxiv.com/d6qhu/)Â to show how the spread of Christianity in Europe meaningfully changed levels prosocial behavior and the broader structure of society. HenrichÂ [writes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769618/)Â that \"humans do not have a general tendency to help, protect, or harm others. Rather, these behaviors are conditioned by many contextual factors.\"\nSo, in the broadest sense, what does religion cause? How do various religions differ in the nature and magnitudes of their effects? Do religions consistently cause different things in different regions, as they interact differently with regional cultures? There are a lot of studies with \"religiosity\" as a variable. What happens when you disaggregate by religion?\n__JosÃ© Luis RicÃ³n wrote aÂ [great post](https://nintil.com/2019/01/05/on-the-causal-powers-of-mormonism/)Â in response to this question. There's some goodÂ [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/acywpg/on_the_causal_powers_of_mormonism/)Â of the post on the SSC subreddit.__\n**Why is there no canon for life's most important questions?**\nIf we go to study economics, we quickly become familiar withÂ __The Wealth of Nations__Â and Keyne'sÂ __General Theory__. If we become interested in moral philosophy, we swiftly encounterÂ __Reasons and Persons__Â andÂ __A Theory of Justice__. But for many of life's most important questions, we won't find any similar canon. That is, there are no similarly definitive books about how to navigate your education, how to select a career, how to choose a partner, how to be a good friend, or how to raise your children well. That's not to say that there aren't lots of books on these questions. There are, of course. But there are none that are so good, or important, that you might assume that others interested in the questions will be familiar with their ideas. Is it not possible for there to be \"great\" books about these questions? Or have they just not been written yet?\n**Why are so many things so much nicer in Switzerland and Japan?**\nCompared to almost all countries (including the US), Switzerland and Japan seem to possess much higher baseline execution quality in almost everything. Buses and trains are better (and more punctual); low-end food is tastier; cheap hotels are more comfortable; their airlines score higher on international indexes (despite not spending more per passenger); streets are cleaner; grocery stores and corner stores are nicer; ostensibly unremarkable villages have more beautiful buildings and are more pleasant places to spend a few days.\n(This phenomenon, whatever it is, may extend even further. The homicide rates in both Japan and Switzerland are about a tenth of that of the US and less than half those of England, France, and Germany.)\nWhat's going on? While wealth is clearly some of the story, it isn't just a matter of wealth: GDP per capita in Japan substantially lags that of the US. Nor does it seem to be a matter ofÂ __historical__Â wealth. (1900 Japan was even further behind.) It doesn't seem to be the simple result of long periods of stability. (Again, Japan.)\nSo, what exactly is this effect? Which things are truly better and by how much? Are these effects the result of the same kind of phenomenon in Switzerland and Japan? Is this in any way related to theirÂ [topping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_economic_complexity)Â the economic complexity index? Could other countries acquire this \"general execution capital\"? And are there meaningful trade-offs involved or is it a kind of free lunch?\n**Why isn't China (yet) producing a lot of top-tier research?**\nIn the fields scientists I'm close to are most familiar with (economics, biology, CS, physics), the consistent report is that little-to-no influential research has yet emerged from Chinese universities. (There's plenty from Japanese, French, German, etc., universities.) This is fairly clearly not the result of any characteristic of the underlying individualsâChinese researchers have done, and continue to do,Â [amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Zhang)Â [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Chueh_Chang)Â while at universities outside of China. Citizens of mainland China haveÂ [won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_Nobel_laureates)Â six Nobel Prizes in the sciences, but only one of those was for work done in China. This is despite the fact that China is now apparentlyÂ [#2 in the world](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-research-and-development-rnd/)Â in R&D funding.\nIt's possible that we're overlooking a lot of great work done at Chinese universities, although the NSFÂ [reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00927-4)Â that academics at Chinese institutions publish more peer-reviewed papers every year than academics at American institutions do, so it doesn't appear to be the case that we're simply ignoring Chinese research in aggregate.\nAssuming thereÂ __is__Â something to be explained here, what are Chinese universities missing?\n**Why don't we build nice neighborhoods any more?**\nThere are lots of nice neighborhoods in the world. Indeed, almost every city has a few of them. But as you happily walk around the hutongs in Beijing, Higashiyama in Kyoto, StarÃ³wka in Warsaw, Palermo in Buenos Aires, Gemmayze in Beirut, or the Village in New York, you notice: they are all old. Indeed, we assume by default that the \"old town\" is the nice part, almost always helpfully accentuated with ochre shade in Google Maps.\nShouldn't this seem weird? Our best computers are not our oldest ones. One might immediately suspect survivorship bias -- presumably we just demolished the bad old neighborhoods and kept the good ones. That doesn't seem quite right, though. It's hard to think ofÂ __any__Â neighborhoods in the US constructed since 1950 that are pleasant, but there are plenty that date from the 17th century (Cambridge MA or Providence RI), despite quite a lot less construction happening back then. If it's just a selection effect, the difference shouldn't be quite so stark.\nMaybe we got worse at making them as a result of optimizing for the car? Nathan Lewis makes aÂ [persuasive](https://newworldeconomics.com/toledo-spain-or-toledo-ohio/)Â case that bad urban design predates its invention, however, and it's a little hard to imagine that the problem could be so neatly monocausal. If so, though, you then have to wonder -- are the dynamics that yielded bad design in Toledo OH (his example) the same as those at play in recently-constructed urban landscapes, like much of Cebu, Philippines?\nWhatever is going on, a growing fraction (about 55% today) of a growing number of humans live in cities. Given that our physical location determines so much of our quality of life, shouldn't we be very distressed that we seem to be gettingÂ __worse__Â at making them? And what else are we getting worse at?\n**What influences when people act in accordance with their self-interest and when they don't?**\nPeople often prefer policies that maximize their own gains. Homeowners, for example, typically favor highly-restrictive zoning policies that inflate the value of their homes. On the other hand,Â [data show](https://capitalresearch.org/article/party-one-percent/)Â that rich Americans seem to consistently favor Democrats over Republicans, which ostensibly contravenes their narrow self-interest. On policy matters, what determines when someone preferences other values ahead of their personal benefit?\n**What's going on with infrastructure?**\nWhen New York decided to build a subway, the first contract was awarded on February 21, 1900. 28 stations opened and general operation commenced on October 27, 1904, 4.7 years later. The total cost was about $1.1 billion in 2019 dollars. ([Source](https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-That-Drove-York-Transportation/dp/3642304834).) In April 2000, the MTA decided to build the Second Avenue Subway. The first phase, with 3 stations, opened on January 1, 2017; it cost $4.45 billion. Despite construction technology having presumably improved in the intervening century, the Second Avenue line was 37x more expensive on a per-station basis.\nThe early days of the US Interstate Highway System saw a construction cost of about $1.5M per mile in 2019 dollars. ([Source](https://www.transportation.gov/testimony/celebrating-50-years-eisenhower-interstate-highway-system).) San Francisco currently projects that aÂ [bus lane](https://www.sfmta.com/projects/van-ness-improvement-project)Â will cost $309.3 million over 2.2 miles, i.e. $140M per mile. This isn't quite like-for-like (SF is merely making some improvements in a readily-accessed urban environment, not constructingÂ __de novo__Â highway), but is nonetheless paying 93x more per mile.\nMost people know that infrastructure is getting more expensive. ([Alon Levy](https://pedestrianobservations.com/author/abstractnonsense/)Â andÂ [Josh Barro](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/why-we-cant-figure-out-why-infrastructure-is-so-expensive.html)Â have some good writing on the topic.) The magnitude of the change is quite startling, however. If technology is about doing more with less, ourÂ __effective__Â technology for manipulating the physical world seems to have drastically deteriorated. In 2019, construction of a single high-speed rail link seems slightly beyond the boundary of what's possible for California, a state with a GDP approximately equal to that of France.\nWill this trend continue? Will we lose the ability to even maintain what we have today? Is this the product of one factor or many? Which countries are exceptions to this trend? What is going on?\n**Why did climatic variability suddenly decline in the Holocene period?**\n![](https://patrickcollison.com/static/files/questions/d18o.png)\nStarting around 12,000 years ago, the earth's climate appears to have become much more stable. The above chart (using data fromÂ [Ditlevson 1996](https://www.nature.com/articles/379810a0)) showsÂ [Î´18O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O)Â concentration of Greenland ice cores, a proxy for temperature. More recently, we've come to think that this data overstates the case. For example,Â [Rehfeld 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25454)Â uses \"a network of marine and terrestrial temperature proxies to show that temperature variability decreased globally by a factor of four\", which is substantially less than what the Greenland ice core data implies. Nonetheless, it seems to be the case that variability decreased significantly in the Holocene period; exactly how much remains somewhat uncertain.\nSome argue that this stability is what enabled the rise of agriculture, and therefore civilization. InÂ [__Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?__](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/AgOrigins_2_12_01.pdf), Richerson argues that climatic variability and low CO2Â levels made agriculture impossible before the Holocene period but mandatory afterwards. InÂ [__Climate Stability and the Origin of Agriculture__](https://www.intechopen.com/books/climate-change-and-agriculture/climate-stability-and-the-origin-of-agriculture), Feynman and Ruzmaikin make broadly the same argument, and point out that \"around 10,000 ybp agricultural societies were independently established in many regions during the same few thousand years\".\nIf true, this seems a big deal. So, to what degree did the climate become more stable in the Holocene period, and to whatever extent it did,Â __why__Â did that happen? InÂ [Maslin 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744739002460), the authors write \"Holocene climate variability still has no adequate explanation and falls in the âgapâ of our knowledge between Milankovitch forcing of ice ages and rapid variations such as El NiÃ±o and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Future research is essential for understanding these climate cycles so that we can better predict the climate response to anthropogenic âglobal warming.â\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model\n![An example of a graphical

that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.\n     For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of lifeâs procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.\n\n     When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.\n     Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?\n\n     Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.\n     But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earthâs furthest dream, assigned to you when the dream was born,\n     And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,\n     And to love life through labour is to be intimate with lifeâs inmost secret.\n\n     But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.\n\n     You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.\n     And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge,\n     And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,\n     And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,\n     And all work is empty save when there is love;\n     And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.\n    \n     And what is it to work with love?\n     It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.\n     It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.\n     It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.\n     It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,\n     And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.\n\n     Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, âHe who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is nobler than he who ploughs the soil.\n     And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.â\n     But I say, not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;\n     And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.\n\n     Work is love made visible.\n     And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.\n     For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half manâs hunger.\n     And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine.\n     And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle manâs ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.\nMemorization Setup::

Carrying on with our person example, a blue eye might look like this:\n`.person__eye--blue { }`\nHere we can see weâre directly modifying the eye Element.\nThings can get more complex, however. Please excuse the crude analogy, and letâs imagine we have a face Element that is handsome. The person themselves isnât that handsome, so we modify the face Element directlyâa handsome face on a regular person:\n`.person__face--handsome { }`\nBut what if that personÂ __is__Â handsome, and we want to style their face because of that fact? A regular face on a handsome person:\n`.person--handsome .person__face { }`\nHere is one of a few occasions where weâd use a [descendant selector](((Xqn7Z7QDw))) to modify an Element based on a Modifier on the Block.\nIf using [[Sass]], we would likely write this like so:\n```css\n.person { }\n\n  .person__face {\n\n    .person--handsome & { }\n\n  }\n\n.person--handsome { }```\nNote that we do not nest a new instance ofÂ .person__face {}Â inside ofÂ .person--handsome {}; instead, we make use of Sassâ parent selectors to prependÂ .person--handsomeÂ onto the existingÂ .person__face {}Â selector. This means that all of ourÂ .person__face {}-related rules exist in once place, and arenât spread throughout the file. This is general good practice when dealing with nested code: keep all of your context (e.g. allÂ .person__face {}Â code) encapsulated in one location.\nImportant ideas\nIf using Sass, we would likely write this like so:\n.person { }\n\n  .person__face {\n\n    .person--handsome & { }\n\n  }\n\n.person--handsome { }\nNote that we do not nest a new instance of`Â .person__face {}`Â inside ofÂ `.person--handsome {}`; instead, we make use of {{or: [[LESS]] | [[Sass]]}}â parent selectors to prependÂ .person--handsomeÂ onto the existingÂ .person__face {}Â selector.

The naming techniques covered in this post are not the original BEM ones, but are improved versions that I much prefer. Whatever the actual notation used, they are all based on the same BEM principles.\nThe naming convention follows this pattern:\n.block {}\n.block__element {}\n.block--modifier {}\n.blockÂ represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.\n.block__elementÂ represents a descendent ofÂ .blockÂ that helps formÂ .blockÂ as a whole.\n.block--modifierÂ represents a different state or version ofÂ .block.\nThe reason for double rather than single hyphens and underscores is so that your block itself can be hyphen delimited, for example:\n```css\n.site-search {} /* Block */\n.site-search__field {} /* Element */\n.site-search--full {} /* Modifier */```\nThe point of BEM is to tell other developers more about what a piece of markup is doing from its name alone. By reading some HTML with some classes in, you can see how â if at all â the chunks are related; something might just be a component, something might be a child, orÂ __element__, of that component, and something might be a variation orÂ __modifier__Â of that component. To use an analogy/model, think how the following things and elements are related:\n```css\n.person {}\n.person__hand {}\n.person--female {}\n.person--female__hand {}\n.person__hand--left {}```\nThe top-level block is a âpersonâ which has elements, for example, âhandâ. A person also has variations, such as female, and that variation in turn has elements. This again, but written in ânormalâ CSS:\n```.person {}\n.hand {}\n.female {}\n.female-hand {}\n.left-hand {}```\nThese all make sense, but are somewhat disconnected. TakeÂ .femaleÂ for example; female what? ^^What aboutÂ .hand; a hand of a clock? A hand in a game of cards? By using BEM we can be more descriptive but also a lot more explicit; we tie concrete links to other elements of our code through naming alone. ^^Powerful stuff.\nFeatured case study: NHS\nHow I helped the NHS rapidly build a brand new product.\n[Read case studyâ¦](https://csswizardry.com/case-studies/nhs-nhsx-elearning-platform/)\nTaking the previousÂ .site-searchÂ example again, with âregularâ naming:\n<form class=\"site-search  full\">\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"field\">\n    <input type=\"Submit\" value =\"Search\" class=\"button\">\n</form>\nThese classes are fairly loose, and donât tell us much. Even though we can work it out, theyâre very inexplicit. With BEM notation we would now have:\n<form class=\"site-search  site-search--full\">\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"site-search__field\">\n    <input type=\"Submit\" value =\"Search\" class=\"site-search__button\">\n</form>\nWe can see that we have a block calledÂ .site-searchÂ which has an element which lives inside it calledÂ .site-search__field. We can also see that there is a variation of theÂ .site-searchÂ calledÂ .site-search--full.\nLetâs take another exampleâ¦\nIf you are familiar with OOCSS then you will no doubt be familiar withÂ [the media object](http://stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code). In BEM form, the media object would now read:\n.media {}\n.media__img {}\n.media__img--rev {}\n.media__body {}\nFrom the way this CSS is written we can already glean thatÂ .media__imgÂ andÂ .media__bodyÂ must live insideÂ .mediaÂ and thatÂ .media__img--revÂ is a slight variation onÂ .media__img. All that information gathered from the names of our CSS selectors alone!\nAnother benefit is the combatting of the following situation. If we take the media object again:\n<div class=\"media\">\n    <img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Foo Corp logo\" class=\"img-rev\">\n    <div class=\"body\">\n        <h3 class=\"alpha\">Welcome to Foo Corp</h3>\n        <p class=\"lede\">Foo Corp is the best, seriously!</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\nFrom looking at this, we canât see how the classesÂ .mediaÂ andÂ .alphaÂ are related to each other? Are they? What aboutÂ .bodyÂ andÂ .ledeÂ orÂ .img-revÂ andÂ .media? From that HTML (unless weâre very familiar with the media object) we have no idea what makes up that component and what else is optional. If we were to rework it with BEM:\n<div class=\"media\">\n    <img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Foo Corp logo\" class=\"media__img  media__img--rev\">\n    <div class=\"media__body\">\n        <h3 class=\"alpha\">Welcome to Foo Corp</h3>\n        <p class=\"lede\">Foo Corp is the best, seriously!</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\nWe can now instantly see thatÂ .mediaÂ is the block,Â .media__img--revÂ is an element ofÂ .mediaÂ that has a modifier applied andÂ .media__bodyÂ is an unmodified element ofÂ .media. All through the names of their classes. That isÂ incrediblyÂ useful.\nUuuugly!\nA common argument against BEM is that itâs ugly; I dare say that if you shy away from code basedÂ __purely__Â on its looks then youâre often missing the point. Unless the code becomes unnecessarily difficult to maintain, or genuinely more difficult to read, then perhaps youÂ __do__Â need to think twice before using it, but if it âjust looks oddâ but has a valid purpose, then it should definitely be fully considered before writing it off.\nI agree that BEM does look weird, but the power it bringsÂ __far__Â outweighs any negatives to do with its appearance by an order of magnitudeâ¦\nBEM may look a little funny â and it might require more typing (most text editors have autocomplete, and gzip will negate any differences in filesize) â but it isÂ soÂ powerful.\nTo BEM or not to BEM?\nI use BEM notation on everything I build now as its usefulness has proved itself over and over. Iâd strongly encourage others to consider adopting it as well because it just makes everything a lot tighter and more connected, making code easier to maintain by teams, or even just by yourself a few months down the line.\nWhen you are using BEM, though, it is important to remember that you donât need to use it for everything. Take for example:\n[[exceptions]] for [[BEM]] [[[[Skill Tree]] [[Templates]]]]\n.caps { text-transform: uppercase; }\nThis CSS would never fall into any BEM category, itâs merely a standalone rule.\nAnother example of code which isnât BEM:\n.site-logo {}\nHere we have our logo; it could be BEMmed up like so:\n.header {}\n.header__logo {}\nBut that is unnecessary. The trick with BEM is knowing when something falls into a relevant category. ((Tb9pzI9C4)) In the case of our site logo it lives in theÂ .headerÂ purely coincidentally; it could just as easily be in our sidebar or footer. An elementâs scope can start in any context, so you need to make sure you only apply BEM as far as you need to. Another example:\n^^**Just because something happens to live inside a block it doesnât always mean is is actually a BEM element.**^^ #[[important]] #[[BEM/Element]] [->](((Y_LYlGyTw)))\n```html\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <h1 class=\"content__headline\">Lorem ipsum dolor...</h1>\n</div>```\nHere ((WO6EpHhDc)) ((5X6H0o__L))it depends on ((RFS5MSf6U)) or whether ((zY0Vop68X)).((jBip8LCWC))\n If it is the latter then we do not need BEM.\n((rusAiUog5)) justÂ __happens__Â to live inÂ .content\nwe might be able to just call [the second class](((rusAiUog5))) Â .headline; \nif ((rusAiUog5)) is styled that wayÂ becauseÂ itâs inÂ .content,\n{{it: content__headline }}\nEverything is potentially open to moving into BEM territory, though. Taking ourÂ .site-logoÂ example again, imagine that we want to have a festive version of the logo for our Christmassy site design. We could have:\n.site-logo {}\n.site-logo--xmas {}\nWe can quickly build variations of things by using theÂ --Â modifier notation.\nOne of the hardest parts of BEM is deciding when to start and stop scope, and when (or not) to use it. Itâs a case of âyouâll just know when you knowâ.\nFinal word\nSo thatâs BEM (or a slight variation thereof); a highly useful, powerful and simple naming convention to make your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit and a lot more strict.\nFor all BEM looks a little odd, it as a hugely valuable addition to the front-end developerâs toolbox, no matter the project.\n[[Roam Change Log]]\n[[Take Home Project]]  [[Backend Role]] [[parser]]\nContext::\nhttps://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1333174002550927360?s=20\nFolks have asked us for a backend problem - comparable to the screen we put up for [[UI Engineer]]\nWe don't have a first filter problem - so we'll just give you one that is useful for us - and since it is useful - if you meet all these requirements all the way -- we'll give you an immediate bounty of $5,000 - and you'll immediately have passed to the final round of interviews where you meet the whole team.\nThis is not `strictly` backend - it's data transformation - but our team is still mostly front-end engineers, so it's a bit tougher for us to come up with a proper backend problem.\nRelated - if you give us a better problem that we go with instead - and that problem is answered within 1 month -- we'll give you $10,000 -- that's ongoing, for all our roles.\ndescription::\nWe try to keep some plaintext representation of all the data folks store in Roam - so that folks can own their data in an actionable real way - take it with them if they leave - or (less risk now that we're profitable and funded) have security if Roam ever disappears.\nThere are some bugs in our parser - it doesn't handle certain kinds of nesting - and it is a bit of a pain to extend -- also - it is painful whenever we want to make up more specific syntax - like for queries.\nWe've been meaning to re-write it.  \nIf you show you can do a better job that we would - we want to talk to you.\nScope::\n5 - 20 hrs\nCriteria::\n{{[[TODO]]}} The parser can parse all of Roam's major syntax at least `[[link]]` `((ref))``{{roam-render}}` `$$latex$$` `[alias](target)` `^^highlight^^` `**bold**` `__italic__`\n{{[[TODO]]}} The parser is recursive - it can handle [[Nested [[Links]]]] and ^^**bold highlights**^^ and `[html roam]([[Aliases]])`all the ones we haven't done yet as well\nSpecifically ```javascript\n\nAliases inside aliases\n>   \n  [![img](image-as-alias.com)](www.roamreasearch.com)\n\n{{{{curly braces}} in{{side}} of {{curly braces}}}}\n\n\n```\n{{[[TODO]]}} Return a Tree - with the result of the parse.\n{{[[TODO]]}} Provide an abstraction for Replacing each item in the tree with something else (like an html component, or a new string value)\nOne aspect of a winning solution might be the equivalent of update-in for a parsed section of the string.\nSimilar to how we might update in a map with swap!\naka - you give us the parsed value in an atom - if we reset that atom, it should change the string at the location of the parse.\n{{[[TODO]]}} Your solution is fast for most cases - it can parse - and replace a string with a hiccup component in - for example 1000strings in under 500ms\nMore points for faster\nAs long as you make it through 95% of them in under 500ms, and push the others off to finish in under 1s\n{{[[TODO]]}} Other ones to thing about\n```javascript\na very winning solution could parse arbitrary code - with an easy abstraction for extending it.\nexample - using insect.js in calculations - and replacing variables with their definitions.\n\nor taking something like\n\nuser wants to find the time between to pieces of text\n\nyou write a parser that looks for a pattern like this - and can then replace it.\n\n<%%:%% - %%:%%>\n13:41 - 14:03  and then replace the whole thing with tthe result of adding them together - or add the string (time % hours) after\n\n\n{:inc 1} {:do-something This | That} \n{â: {:style :snooze, :delay 1day, :every 2hours, :rule (if (= 2 2) (inc :delay) (dec :delay))} }```\n[[The Ones Who Crossed The Rubicon]]\nThis page is to [[Honor]] the [[Hackers]] in [[RoamCult]] who used [[roam/js]] to build core features of Roam before we did\nhttps://twitter.com/shodty/status/1288260174566719488\nauthor:: [[Shodty]]\nreleased as roam/js:: [[July 28th, 2020]]\nincorporated into core:: [[November 21st, 2020]] \n{{embed: ((RGqCl_w4M))}}\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam%2FiMQ5a8mmal.gif?alt=media&token=f1b6d5b5-ad70-4ff9-bd6c-5143a527811f)\n[[What People Are Saying]]\nhttps://twitter.com/jongold/status/1334385207374299137?s=20\nhttps://twitter.com/jongold/status/1334385834200481795?s=20\n")
